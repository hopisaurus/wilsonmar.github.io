This tutorial describes the options AWS provides to automate setup of multi-stage (dev+QA+prod) enterprise environments within EC2.

The options:

   * <a href="#ManualConfig">Manually configure</a> the various components using the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://aws.amazon.com/"> AWS Management Console at
      http://aws.amazon.com/</a> on internet browsers.
    See [my AWS On-boarding](/aws-onboarding/) for a tutorial on the AWS Management Console and Consoles on mobile devices.

   * <a href="#Beanstalk">Elastic Beanstalk</a> for developers to quickly bring up standard server configurations with no SSH capability.

   * <a href="#Opsworks">Opsworks</a> "configuration as code service" which sets up servers by
   running <strong>Chef</strong> recipies obtained from a Chef Cookbook repository.

   * <a href="#CF">CloudFormation</a> for sysadmins to create JSON template files which configure ALL AWS services.

   * <a href="#AnsibleCF">Ansible using CloudFormation</a>.

   * Value-added services outside Amazon, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/#products">
   Terraform (and licensed Atlas) from Hashicorp</a>.

## Manually configure component services #

Each environment within AWS for enterprise use requires several services.
Here is the sequence of dependencies:

   0. VPN
   0. <a href="#VPC">VPC</a>
   0. <a href="#NAT">NAT</a>

   0. <a href="#DNS">DNS</a>
   0. <a href="#ELB">ELB</a>

   0. <a href="#MapRegionAMI">AMI</a> by Region, with Auto-scale

## Elastic Beanstalk #

Before doing this, setup default
VPC, subnets, and Security Groups.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-west-2#/gettingStarted">
   Services > Compute > Beanstalk</a>

   NOTE: You can't SSH into individual servers.

0. Specify an <strong>Application Name</strong>.

   PROTIP: Define a convention that applies to apps, such as a project, feature, and version number, such as
   PS1-bean2-node-v01.

   PROTIP: Include in the name a code for the platform being used.

0. Select a <strong>Platform</strong>.

   <amp-img width="305" height="227" alt="aws beanstalk platforms 2016-06-04 610x454"
layout="responsive" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15802811/6295c404-2a7d-11e6-8a6c-a446a0058732.png"></amp-img>

0. Click <strong>Configure more options</strong>.

   Beanstalk is considered a "Platform-as-a-Service" (PaaS),
   that does the "heavy lifting" to get infrastructure online,
   with load balancing, autoscaling, and health monitoring.

   The Virtual Machine is for the Platform chosen in the previous step.

   The <strong>Low cost</strong> configuration preset is the default.

   In the Scaling section, the Environment type is <strong>single instance</strong>.

0. Click the <strong>Highly available</strong> configuration preset.

   Notice the Environment type changed to "loadbalancing, autoscaling" with
   Scale instance: 1-4.

   Beanstalk is free to use. You only pay for servers deployed by it.

0. Click Modify in the Notifications section and input your email address.

0. Switch temporarily to your email to confirm the subscription.

0. Since this is a tutorial, select the <strong>Low cost single instance</strong>.

0. Scroll down to click <strong>Create app</strong>.

### Beanstalk Settings #

Configuration information stored in the <strong>.ebextensions</strong> folder containing:

* a dynamodb.config

   The file contains functions definitions such as `Fn::GetOptionSetting:` with parameters.

* a options.config files.

* The <strong>.elasticbeanstalk</strong> folder ???

<a href="Opsworks"></a>

## Opsworks Chef #

Opsworks is a higher level tool than CloudFormation,
offering more customization than Elastic Beanstalk.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/home?region=us-west-2#">
   Services > Management Tools > Opsworks</a>

0. Click Add your first stack.

   NOTE: You cannot mix and match Windows with Linux servers.

Opsworks is called a "configuration as code service"
because it sets up servers by
running <strong>Chef</strong> recipies obtained from a Cookbook repository.

   NOTE: There is no equivalent for Puppet.

Each "layer" is a blueprint and container for instances.
(JSON) defining stacks:

* OpsWorks
* ECS
* RDS

   A different Chef recipie for each event within the lifecycle :

   * Setup
   * Configure
   * Deploy
   * Undeploy
   * Shutdown

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danilop/opsworks-cookbooks/">
Opsworks Cookbooks</a> from @Danilop.

NOTE: Each server has a Chef agent installed.

   The lack of agents is why Ansible is becoming more popular.
