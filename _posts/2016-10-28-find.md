Here are my notes on finding and replacing stuff.

## Hidden files

If you are searching for hidden files:

   http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/


## Using Command line

0. cd to the path

0. To find text "Exception" <strong>within</strong> 
   files of ".md" type at the current folders down:

   <tt><strong>
   find . –name "*.md" –print | xargs grep "Exception"
   </strong></tt>

Find "foo" within files by diving recursively into folders :

   grep -ri "foo" .

   Remove the i to not ignore case distinctions.

Display print only the filenames with GNU grep:

   grep -r -l "foo" .

   https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-recursively-search-all-files-for-words/

Use -print0 option to find filenames that contain spaces or other metacharacters:

   find /path/to/dir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l "foo"


### Find file names

Find files using file-name ( case in-sensitve find)

   find -iname "MyCProgram.c"

Execute commands on files found by the find command

   find -iname "MyCProgram.c" -exec md5sum {} \;

Find all empty files in home directory

   find ~ -empty
