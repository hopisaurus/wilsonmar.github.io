Here are my notes on finding and replacing stuff.

## Using Command line

The one I use the most: find text "Exception" <strong>within</strong> 
files of ".md" type at the current folders down:

   <tt><strong>
   find . –name "*.md" –print | xargs grep "Exception"
   </strong></tt>


3. find command examples

Find files using file-name ( case in-sensitve find)

   find -iname "MyCProgram.c"

Execute commands on files found by the find command

   find -iname "MyCProgram.c" -exec md5sum {} \;

Find all empty files in home directory

   find ~ -empty
