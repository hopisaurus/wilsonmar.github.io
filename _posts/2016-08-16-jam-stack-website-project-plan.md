Here are the sequence of specific steps to build a website using
a <a target="_blank" href="https://jamstack.org/">"JAM stack"</a> 
-- a set of software to create websites that are fast, scalable, and simple to work with. 
JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.
JavaScript on the site makes calls to API (Application Programming Interfaces) web services in the cloud
to manage subscription forms and email campaigns.
Content for the site is written in semi-technical markup language text stored on GitHub.com.

We have here a way for artists to manage and display their <strong>portfolio</strong> of 
photos in <strong>file folders</strong> distributed across the internet for fast retrieval anywhere in the world.

We want the photos to show up in a <strong>list or table</strong> on a web page 
visitors obtain by typing in a <strong>topic</strong> on their web browser.

The Portfolio listing is used to select files for 
<strong>processes</strong> such as identifying file sizes plus compression and watermarking of each photo.

The program may also load the portfolio file into a 
<strong>database</strong> for other programs to access online.

Metadata, such as a description about each work in the portfolio, 
are usually entered by hand or via audio recording.

The portfolio file is in .csv (comma separated values) format 
which is <strong>text</strong> that can be edited by any text editor.
Many prefer to edit such files locally using a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
And storing files in <strong>GitHub</strong> allows us to 
go back to each complete version at various points in time.
Complete copies of a repository are obtained from GitHub.

What's amazing about GitHub is that it 
not only hosts websites for free,
it runs a program called <strong>Jekyll</strong> that applies
colors and fonts and layouts specified in <strong>templates</strong> 
to each <strong>topic</strong>.

We like to use the Jekyll program because it 
<strong>generates</strong> an index.html file for each topic.
It puts all the files for a website within a 
<strong>_site</strong> folder published to the internet.

The file for a topic can contain text which replace
<strong>variables</strong> defined in the main section of that page.

Before it does all that, we have a <strong>parser</strong> 
program that can generate a file for each item in the portfolio,
or create a <strong>text file</strong>
which replaces the <strong>{include}</strong> tag in a topic file.

Coding in web pages interact with a 
<strong>form processing API</strong> on a server to handle 
both generic portfolio data and data specific to each visitor

A <strong>publisher</strong> program can match the interests of those who <strong>register</strong>
with <strong>Tags</strong> describing each portfolio item when it
sends out emails, Instagram, Twitter, or other social network messages, on a schedule.

So here you have it, a way to create a website that allows local editing,
have versioned backups, speed from pre-distributed static files, and 
audience interaction from social media attraction.

   design innovations and limitations to other parts of the site in order for the whole site to remain consistent in look and feel.
