I was confused.

There are so many parameters to so many Git commands.

So for the last year, I've scoured the interet to view every blog, video, and book about the subject.

I figured that if I was so confused, others are as well.

Below are the notes and drawings from me trying to make sense of it all.

I've worked hard to come up with a logical sequence to speed your learning.


## Playlist

You may prefer accessing the videos via this playlist:

> <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/12C1BF">https://goo.gl/12C1BF</a>

A playlist link lists the latest versions because individual videos can be added or removed.

Direct links to individual YouTube videos can become stale when newer versions are downloaded.

The diagram above is animated in PowerPoint and go with a narrative to each step.
I then created a screencast video of it.
And a step-by-step hands-on tutorial to explain each step.
