Comparisons vs. the competition need to be factual and fair.

Here is a nice-looking example:

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.versatables.com/discover/product-comparisons/competitor-comparisons/">
<img alt="table white versatable comparison" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14229472/ef70d5d4-f8f1-11e5-83a0-6f666e5f5af4.jpg" width="790" height="563">
Source: Versatables</a>
<!-- /images/table comparison table 790x563.jpg -->

## Questions of Fairness

* It would help if the site identifies the source of Customer Service ratings,
  such as Amazon, etc.

   Independent lab ConsumerReports.com does not allow others to quote their 
   ratings.

* One question about the ratings is whether some metrics, such as 
   Lifetime warranty, Green Manufacturing, etc.
   apply to all products in their inventory, or just the alternatives to Versatables
   furniture.

* Note this table does not mention prices.


## Software service comparison #

One suggestion is to have fonts large enough to be readable.
