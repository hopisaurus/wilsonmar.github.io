This article explains the <strong>quickest</strong> and <strong>least cost way</strong> 
developers can create servers configured for production use.


## Frictionless DevOps 2.0 #

Twitter hashtag "\#DevOps_2.0"

   0. servers run <strong>on-premises</strong> or on 
   <strong>any major cloud environment</strong> (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.)
   
   0. servers are built on whichever cloud has the <strong>lowest cost</strong> 

   0. server configurations are treated like textual programming code residing
   within a <strong>versioned source repository</strong>
   GitHub, or Bitbucket in the cloud or GitLab <strong>on-premises</strong>

   0. server configurations are defined using <strong>declarative</strong> 
   statements that specify the <strong>end result</strong>
   rather than specific steps

   0. a single server configurate can be applied to <strong>several operating systems</strong>

   0. when a server configuration is run several times, it doesn't create a mess
   (this is called "idempotent").

   0. differences in creating servers for test, demo, prod, and other stages
   are handled automatically without requiring explicit manual specification.
   This also provides traceability.

   0. monitoring and other utility software are automatically added to servers

   0. notifications are sent via variety of channels (email, SMS text, IRC, Slack, Skype, etc.)

   0. developers don't need to learn Jenkins and Chef

## Software #

All this is achieved by tools from several developer groups.

   * GitHub / Bitbucket / GitLab
   * Docker.com
   * Kubernetes.com
   * Artifactory server image repository
   * Shippable.com 
   * container registry services in cloud environments
   * Shippable Lighthouse service watches and sends <strong>notifications</strong> to Slack, IRC, etc.

## Container services # 

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">
   Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS)</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/">
   Google Container Engine (GKE)</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/">Microsoft Azure Container Service</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.docker.com/">Docker Cloud</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-datacenter">Docker Datacenter</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="">https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/">Red Hat Openshift 3</a>


## Upgrade from DevOps 1.0 #

How long does it take to make a small change ... and get it to the customer?
   through tests in various environments 
   which gets more complex as more developers and components

less developers to do the same work

"DevOps 2.0" improves on where the "12 Factor App" promise of DevOps has stalled:

   * software too complex to learn
   * software too difficult to test in production
   * software too brittle
   * software operates only within a single vendor's environment
   * inconsistencies of servers in different stages and environments


## Technical Descriptions #

Docker containerized environments
use Docker Swarm and Compose

Alternative is Mesos-based DC/OS 

<strong>Kubernetes</strong> software watches and adjusts the number of servers as appropriate.

"Minions" (workers)

<strong>Formation</strong>
like shipping lanes for applications
 <strong>pipelines</strong> 


individual deployment units are called <strong>Cells</strong>.
