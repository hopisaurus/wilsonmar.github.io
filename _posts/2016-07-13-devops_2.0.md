This article explains the <strong>quickest</strong> and <strong>least cost way</strong> 
to create servers for test or production use at enterprise scale.

Below is a summary of the funcamental strategies to achieve speed for less money.
It's not doing the same thing faster.
It's a new way of working
that takes less time and less risk to achieve more.


## Frictionless \#DevOps_2.0 #

The narrative to the diagram above is here:

   0. Servers run <strong>on-premises</strong> or on 
   <strong>any major cloud environment</strong> (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.),
   whichever cloud at the <strong>lowest cost</strong>.
   Such arbitrage can save money.

   0. Server configurations are treated like textual programming code residing
   within a <strong>versioned source repository</strong>
   GitHub, or Bitbucket in the cloud or GitLab <strong>on-premises</strong>

   0. Server configurations are defined using <strong>declarative</strong> 
   statements that specify the <strong>end result</strong>
   rather than specific steps
   This means when a server configuration is run several times, it doesn't create a mess
   (this is called "idempotent")

   0. A single server configuration can be applied to one of
   <strong>several operating systems</strong> by use of 
   <strong>Docker containers</strong>
   instead of hypervisors which repeat OS kernels in memory

   0. Automation engines (such as Shippable) covers the entire pipeline
   so integration of Jenkins with 3rd-party tools doesn't risk projects

   0. Differences in creating servers for test, demo, prod, and other stages
   are handled automatically without requiring explicit manual scripting
   Thus, monitoring and various other utility software for diagnosis
   are automatically added to each type of server

   0. Instances can be created quicker if build results can 
   saved in a build repository (such as Artifactory) for reuse
   rather than building each instance from source code

Common to both are notifications 
sent via variety of channels (email, SMS text, IRC, Slack, Skype, etc.)

## Software for DevOps 2.0 #

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.eightypercent.net/post/layers-in-the-stack.html">
Joe Bada's list is way more comprehensive</a>,
which this post highlights.


"DevOps 2.0" is achieved by tools from several developer groups.

   * GitHub / Bitbucket / GitLab
   * Docker.com
   * Kubernetes.com
   * Artifactory server image repository
   * Shippable.com 
   * container registry services in cloud environments
   * Shippable Lighthouse service watches and sends <strong>notifications</strong> to Slack, IRC, etc.

## Container services # 

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">
   Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS)</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/">
   Google Container Engine (GKE)</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/">Microsoft Azure Container Service</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.docker.com/">Docker Cloud</a>
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-datacenter">Docker Datacenter</a>

## Why Upgrade from DevOps 1.0 #

How long does it take to make a small change ... and get it to the end customer? ...
   through tests in various environments 
   which gets more complex as more developers and components

"DevOps 2.0" improves on where the "12 Factor App" promise of DevOps has stalled:

   * software too complex to learn
   * software too difficult to test in production
   * software too brittle
   * software operates only within a single vendor's environment
   * inconsistencies of servers in different stages and environments


## Vendors #

   "Staging Servers Must Die"
   XebiaLabs ‚Äè@xebialabs https://t.co/oL8G01wq3i

Integration offerings such as Zapier,



## Technical Descriptions #

Docker containerized environments
use Docker Swarm and Compose

Alternative is Mesos-based DC/OS 

<strong>Kubernetes</strong> software watches and adjusts the number of servers as appropriate.

"Minions" (workers)

<strong>Formation</strong>
like shipping lanes for applications
 <strong>pipelines</strong> 


individual deployment units are called <strong>Cells</strong>.


## No-script deploy? #

Shippable's UI

The main difference is that 
<strong>developers don't need to learn Jenkins and Chef</strong>.
