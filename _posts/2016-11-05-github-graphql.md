{% include _toc.html %}

GitHub provides a well-known API that accepts a lot of traffic.

GitHub's API is considered an industry-standard we would do well to emulate:

   * [HATEOS-based REST API, (my BFF last year)](/github-api/) such as 
  [PowerShellforGitHub](/powershell-github/)

   * GraphQL (this article)

## GitHub's GraphQL

See https://developer.github.com/early-access/graphql/

Use the https://developer.github.com/early-access/graphql/explorer/

Perform an <a target="_blank" href="http://graphql.org/learn/introspection/">
introspection query</a>.
As the GraphQL schema matures, new data types appear.

Make a single call to retrieve (rather than many REST API calls).

Response is structured using the same JSON hierarchy as the call.

Changes can occur with less fuss than REST API.


## PowerShellforGitHubGraphQL module

I couldn't find a PSGallery module for referencing GitHub's GraphQL,
so I set out to create one when that's what Karol Kaczmarek
suggested I do.

  [PowerShellforGitHub](/powershell-github/)

The Functions folder contains Private and Public folders.
