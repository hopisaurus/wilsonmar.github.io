{% include _toc.html %}

I'm looking for a more efficient way to make videos to explain concepts.

It takes me one day for each second of video produced.

0. Write down every word as I create a diagram or flowchart in PowerPoint
0. Define animations to reveal parts of the diagram (in PowerPoint)
0. Record voice narration as I reveal each part of the diagram. I usually tweak the text to make them easier to say
0. Record live video introduction and ending, if applicable
0. Create one image for each step in the process
0. Paste the mp3 narration voice media into Camtasia
0. Add captions to the audio track
0. Position to precisely reveal each graphic element to match the narration sound
0. Add zoom in or out as appropriate
0. Generate the video and send to YouTube, DailyMotion, etc.
0. Extract (srt file) from Camtasia and add to YouTube
0. Get feedback and revise
