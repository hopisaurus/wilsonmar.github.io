### US Census #

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/developers">
http://www.census.gov/developers</a>
contains a wide list of data available freely.

BLAH: Even though this site is maintained by a federal organization,
not all datasets have data for the entire nation (all 50 states of the union
  and territories).

The javascript SDK for US Census Bureau data stored at
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/uscensusbureau/citysdk">
GitHub CitySDK</a>
and described at
<a target="_blank" href="https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk">
https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk</a>,
includes simple integrations to facilitate mash-up of other open datasets.

The JavaScript uses the "Module pattern" of coding that uses a "closure".

A sample end point for data from the 2010 census for all states:

```
api.census.gov/data/2010/sf1?key=...&get=P0010001,NAME=&for=state:*
```

The ... above is replaced by each user's own API key
obtained from email after registration at
<a target="_blank" href="http://api.census.gov/data/citysdk.html">
http://api.census.gov/data/citysdk.html</a>


## Other APIs #

https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/04/wanted-simple-apis-without-authentication/
lists several.

* Ford
* GM
* Citrix


## Mashups #
