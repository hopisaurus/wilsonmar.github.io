GraphQL was invented within Facebook.

   <a target="_blank" href="http://graphql.org/blog/">
   http://graphql.org/blog</a> says

> GraphQL has been delivering data to Facebook mobile News Feed since 2012.

   Facebook released it publicly in 2015 at:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">
   http://facebook.github.io/graphql</a>

The status of community as of November 5, 2015:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=GraphQL">

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7075066/profile">
   149 members in the "GraphQL User Group" on LinkedIn</a> which succintly describes GraphQL thus:
   <br /><br />

   "GraphQL is the new standard for data API from Facebook, superseding REST. It allows a single data graph with strongly typed schema to serve just as much data as needed from a client. GitHub is switching to GraphQL already.""

It was a necessity for the world's busiest mobile app for these advantages over REST API:

   * Perform an <a target="_blank" href="http://graphql.org/learn/introspection/">
   introspection query</a>.
   As the GraphQL schema matures, new data types appear.

   * Make a single call to retrieve (rather than many REST API calls).

   * Response is structured using the same JSON hierarchy as the call.
   A shared schema language between front-end and back-end. This is hugh.

   * Changes can occur with less fuss (pain) than REST API. No large version migrations.

   * Static queries make loading predictable.

   * Schema says which fields are being used, so caching is possible.
   <br /><br />

## Facebook Relay vs. Apollo

   Facebook also released its Relay server to respond to GraphQL queries.

## Relay PowerShellforGitHubGraphQL module

I couldn't find a PSGallery module for referencing GitHub's GraphQL,
so I set out to create one when that's what Karol Kaczmarek
suggested I do.
