GraphQL was invented within Facebook.

   <a target="_blank" href="http://graphql.org/blog/">
   http://graphql.org/blog</a> says:

> GraphQL has been delivering data to Facebook mobile News Feed since 2012.

   Facebook released it publicly in 2015 at:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">
   http://facebook.github.io/graphql</a>

   <br /><br />

> "GraphQL is the new standard for data API from Facebook, superseding REST. It allows a single data graph with strongly typed schema to serve just as much data as needed from a client. GitHub is switching to GraphQL already."

It was a necessity for the world's busiest mobile app for these advantages over REST API:

   * Perform an <a target="_blank" href="http://graphql.org/learn/introspection/">
   introspection query</a>.
   As the GraphQL schema matures, new data types appear.

   * Make a single call to retrieve (rather than many REST API calls).

   * Response is structured using the same JSON hierarchy as the call.
   A shared schema language between front-end and back-end. This is hugh.

   * Changes can occur with less fuss (pain) than REST API. No large version migrations.

   * Static queries make loading predictable, and cleaner server metric insights.

   * Schema says which fields are being used, so caching (persisted queries) is possible.

## Facebook Relay vs. Apollo

   Facebook also released its 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">
   Relay server</a> to respond to GraphQL queries.
   It's a JS framework based on React Redux.

> CAUTION: Look at the licensing statements from Facebook.
   You should not use works from Facebook if you might have a
   product that might infringe on something Facebook may do in the future,
   such as any social networking, including IoT.

   An alternative is SPARQL.

   https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/
   is based on React Redux, React Native

   Apollodata.com/Optics provides metrics:
   execution traces,
   field latencies,
   field usage

## Clients

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka/">

## Client features

   * Query builder
   * Cache
   * Retry
   * Error handling
   * Rollback

   * Conditional fetching
   * Mutations
   * Fragments group commonly used fields and reuses them.
   * Optimistic UI
   * Pagination

## PowerShellforGitHubGraphQL module

I couldn't find a PSGallery module for referencing GitHub's GraphQL,
so I set out to create one when that's what Karol Kaczmarek
suggested I do.
