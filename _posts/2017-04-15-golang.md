This is a quick step-by-step introduction to the Go programming language (GoLang)
unveiled in 2009.

## Install

0. Use third-party software installers to automatically manage versions.

   If you use Homebrew on your Mac, install using:

   <pre><strong>
   brew install golang
   </strong></pre>

   Alternately, MacPorts:

   <pre>
   sudo port install go
   </pre>

   If you must, download installer from: 

   https://golang.org/dl/

   storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.4.darwin-amd64.pkg 

   The which goland shows installation to folder:

   /usr/local/bin/go

0. Run it

0. Create a folder 

   <pre>
   cd ~
   mkdir go
   cd go
   mkdir src
   </pre>

   ### Source files folder

0. In an internet browser (Chrome or Firefox):

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples</a>

0. Edit (~/.bash_profile on Macs) to create $GOPATH

   <pre>
   export GOPATH="$HOME/gits/wilsonmar/golang-samples"
   </pre>

   Alternately, append by using this command:

   echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile

0. Open a new Terminal
0. Verify

   <pre>echo $GOPATH</pre>

0. Go Home ???

   $GOHOME

   $GOROOT

0. Navigate to the default home folder.

   cd $GOHOME

   ### Define environment

0. Create a src folder.

0. git clone https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples

   PROTIP: Go source code files exist within a folder of the same name and have a suffix of .go. 

   ### Hello World Code

0. In https://play.golang.org/p/0Hz57BQdTA

   <pre>
// hello.go
package main
import "fmt"
import "time"
var now = time.Now()
func main() {
    fmt.Printf("hello, world at %v",now)
}
   </pre>

   Example response:

   <pre>
   2017-04-15 17:32:52.470348041 -0600 MDT
   </pre>

Go is an opinionated language:

   * Compiler doesn't issue warnings, just errors
   * Unused local variables are an error
   * fmt is the single way to format output

Like C:

   * Strongly typed
   * Used by developers of C (Kernigan)
   * Memory is zeroed if not explicitly initialized

Like Java:

   * Collects garbage
   * Is memory safe by default
   * Networking is baked into the standard library and runtime

UnLike both:

   * double slashes for comments
   * needs to be built (not interpreted like Python)
   * low GC pause (100 microseconds)
   * compiles fast to native code


   ### Fast to compile

0. In a Terminal

   <pre><strong>
   go build
   </strong></pre>

   A file should appear in the folder.


## Usage

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2016-results">
The 2016 survey</a> found that 40% of respondants used the language for less that 1 year.

The greatest use is in runnable/interactive program (CLI).

When asked what they like most about Go, users most commonly mentioned Go’s simplicity, ease of use, concurrency features, and performance.

When asked what changes would most improve Go, users most commonly mentioned generics, package versioning, and dependency management. Other popular responses were GUIs, debugging, and error handling.

The Go compiler is programmed in Go itself rather than C.

Go isn’t an appropriate fit for iOS, JS.

## Data Types

All source code in Go is UTF-8, so you can use Kanji.

   <pre>
    var π = 3.14159
    var radius = 6371.0 // radius of the Earth in km
    var circumference = 2 * π * radius
&nbsp;
    println("Circumference of the earth is", circumference, "km")
   </pre>

   Run result in scientific notation:

   <pre>
   Circumference of the earth is +4.003014e+004 km
   </pre>


boolean constants are lower case: true, false

Numbers are not permitted at the start of an identifier (variable)

Go detects unused imports as an error.

Conditionals: 

    <pre>
    var n int = 4
    var i = 0
    for i = 1; i < n; i++ {
        println(i)
    }
    </pre>

int is actually an alias.

Like C, Go has signed integers: int8, int16, int32, int64.

   * int holds a maximum value of 32,000.

unsigned integers: uint8, uint6, uint32, uint64.

Alias <strong>rune</strong> are single-character constants: 'a', す', 'シ', '1', …


### Time handling

See https://golang.org/pkg/time/


## Logic

   if … { … } else { … }, switch { … }

for (init statement); condition; (post statement) { … }

   As Go is a strongly typed language, for two variables to be equal, both their type and their value must be equal.

Heavily nested if else if blocks are discouraged in Go.

Instead we can use the other condition statement, switch.

while condition { … }

do { … } while condition

do { … } until condition

Loops: for … { … }

Control flow: break, fallthrough, continue, goto, return.


## Concurrency features

The design of the Go language makes it work on multiple CPU cores.
Go's language runtime makes sure that there are enough threads to keep cores active.

Go has "goroutines" that are lightweight concurrency model based on coroutines.
Goroutines do not use convoluted callback coding styles.

Go's defer command.
