{% include _toc.html %}

This is a quick step-by-step introduction to the Go programming language (GoLang).

Although unveiled in 2009, companies who have adopted Go in their products include
Atlassian, Docker, Facebook, DigitalOcean, eBay, Heroku.

"Gothic" is Go's way of saying idiomatic Go code just like Python has Pythonic.


## Hello World Code in Go Playground

0. A Tour of Go: https://tour.golang.org/list

0. In <a target="_blank" href="https://play.golang.org/p/0Hz57BQdTA">https://play.golang.org/p/0Hz57BQdTA</a>

   <pre>
// hello.go
package main
import( "fmt"; "time")
var now = time.Now()
func main() {
    fmt.Printf("hello, world at %v",now)
}
   </pre>

   Example response, the default time format is of the time of initial commit:

   <pre>
   2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC
   1257894000 epoch time
   </pre>


Go is an opinionated language:

   * Compiler doesn't issue warnings, just errors
   * Unused local variables are an error
   * fmt is the single way to format output

Like C:

   * Strongly typed (must specify data type in commands)
   * Used by developers of C (Kernigan)
   * Uses its own compiler to create itself

Unlike C:

   * Go has no pointer arithmetic. See https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/1

Like Java:

   * Collects garbage
   * Is memory safe by default
   * Networking is baked into the standard library and runtime

Like both:

   * needs to be built (not interpreted like Python)
   * double slashes for comments

UnLike both:

   * there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement 
   * low GC pause (100 microseconds)
   * fast compile to native code
   * Memory is zeroed if not explicitly initialized

<hr />

## Install Compiler

0. If there was a previous version installed:

   Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8... (7,017 files, 281.6MB)

0. Use third-party software installers so new versions can be managed automatically.

   If you use Homebrew on your Mac, install using:

   <pre><strong>
   brew install golang
   </strong></pre>

   Alternately, MacPorts:

   <pre>
   sudo port install go
   </pre>

   Ignore the web page which says download installer from: 

   https://golang.org/dl/

   storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.4.darwin-amd64.pkg 

0. Consider a paid, commercially supported, quality-assured Go distribution
   for big data, database connectivity, code quality, microservices/cloud development:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.activestate.com/activego">
   https://www.activestate.com/activego</a>

   NOTE: This was in "beta" as of April, 2017.

0. See where the go command references:

   <pre><strong>
   go version
   </strong></pre>

   shows (at time of writing):

   <pre>
   go version go1.8.1 darwin/amd64
   </pre>

   ### Source files folder

0. In an internet browser (Chrome or Firefox):

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples</a>

   Its contents is <a href="#MyCodeSamples">described here below</a>.

   Alternately,<br />
   https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go/

0. Fork the sample repository to your own GitHub account.

0. Switch to a Terminal shell window.

0. Create a folder to hold various Git repositories (personal preference here, replacing wilsonmar with your account name):

   <pre>
   cd ~
   mkdir gits
   cd gits
   mkdir wilsonmar
   cd wilsonmar
   </pre>

0. Edit (~/.bash_profile on Macs) to create $GOPATH (replacing wilsonmar with your account name):

   <pre>
   export GOPATH="$HOME/gits/wilsonmar/golang-samples"
   </pre>

   Alternately, append by using this command:

   echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile

0. Navigate to the default home folder.

   <pre>cd $GOHOME</pre>

0. <strong>git clone https://github.com/wilsonmar/golang-samples</strong>

   PROTIP: Go source code files exist within a folder of the same name and have a suffix of .go. 

0. Verify by getting the environment settings:

   <pre><strong>
   go env
   </strong></pre>

   shows (at time of writing), on a Mac:

   <pre>
GOARCH="amd64"
GOBIN=""
GOEXE=""
GOHOSTARCH="amd64"
GOHOSTOS="darwin"
GOOS="darwin"
GOPATH="/Users/mac/gits/wilsonmar/golang-samples"
GORACE=""
GOROOT="/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8.1/libexec"
GOTOOLDIR="/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.8.1/libexec/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64"
GCCGO="gccgo"
CC="clang"
GOGCCFLAGS="-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/var/folders/j_/gh27gpxj1t58hyryfg9drvdc0000gn/T/go-build434742939=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches -fno-common"
CXX="clang++"
CGO_ENABLED="1"
PKG_CONFIG="pkg-config"
CGO_CFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_CPPFLAGS=""
CGO_CXXFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_FFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_LDFLAGS="-g -O2"
   </pre>


   ### Auto format

0. Format source code according to Go coding standards:

   <pre><strong>
   go gofmt [flags] [path ...]
   </strong></pre> 

   See https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/
   about flags

   ### GoImports

0. Install and configuring goimports to automatically run on save
   to format and auto adjust import statements as needed:

   <pre>
   go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports
   </pre>

   BLAH: I'm getting these messages:

   <pre>
package code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports: unrecognized import path "code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports" (parse https://code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports?go-get=1: no go-import meta tags (meta tag github.com/golang/go did not match import path code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports))
   </pre>   

0. Setup vim to auto run goimports on save using vim-go:

   <pre>
   let g:go_fmt_command = "goimports"
   </pre>

   BLAH: Response is "-bash: let: g:go_fmt_command: syntax error in expression (error token is ":go_fmt_command")"

0. Setup reload web server when file change is detected:

   https://github.com/shenfeng/http-watcher

   https://bitbucket.org/gotamer/gowatch   

   ### IDE

   Unlike C#, Go is not associated with an IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio.
   However, shortcuts and reformat are provided for text editors:

0. Install

   * TextMate 2 has a Go bundle at http://macromates.com/download

   * vim has a vim-go package at https://github.com/fatih/vim-go



## Usage of Go

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2016-results">
The 2016 survey</a> found that 40% of respondants used the language for less that 1 year.

The greatest use is in runnable/interactive program (CLI).

When asked what they like most about Go, users most commonly mentioned Go’s simplicity, ease of use, concurrency features, and performance.

When asked what changes would most improve Go, users most commonly mentioned generics, package versioning, and dependency management. Other popular responses were GUIs, debugging, and error handling.

The Go compiler is programmed in Go itself rather than C.

   https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/04/how-go-uses-go-to-build-itself

Go isn’t an appropriate fit for iOS, JS.


Due to its small size, Go can be a good fit for use on a Raspberry Pi small computer
to receive and provide small amounts of data.

## My Code Samples

Files in my CodeSamples repo. combine several aspects of the language as useful programs.

0. In a Terminal shell window.

   ## hello-time.go template

0. cd to <strong>hello-time</strong>, which I use as the basis for creating new files.

   * print the elasped time of the program run.
   * define a date
   * calculate days from hours
   * format dates based on a template
   * see https://coderwall.com/p/l7e3fq/golang-time-function-wrapper

0. The line at the top of the file enables it to be optionally run as a shell sript:

   <pre><strong>
   chmod 555 hello-time.go
   ./hello-temp.go
   </strong></pre>

0. Run it as a program:

   <pre><strong>
   go run hello-time.go
   </strong></pre>

0. Build it

   <pre><strong>
   go build
   </strong></pre>

   A file with no file extension should appear in the folder on Linux.
   Extension .exe is added on Windows machines.

   When compiling packages, build ignores files that end in '_test.go'.


0. Run the executable on Linux:

   <pre><strong>
   ./hello-time
   </strong></pre>

   Alternately, on Windows, run the executable:

   <pre><strong>
   hello-time.exe
   </strong></pre>


   ### Random number generator
   
0. cd to <strong>rand</strong>

   * Import flag to obtain arguments from command line
   * Reflection of elasped time is not appropriate here because it is intended to run as a utility.
   * Defined in a main plus separate utility functions.
   * Loop the number of repeats specified.
   * Slice of an integer array containing prime numbers. See https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/8
   * Pointer

   ### Loop until manually stopped

   Within a main infinite loop:

   <pre>
func main() {
  var input string
  for {
  fmt.Scanln(&input)
  }
}
   </pre>

0. cd to <strong>switch</strong>

   * Print command to construct a line printed over several command lines
   * Recognize operating system being used by using "runtime.GOOS".

0. cd to <strong>strings</strong>

   * One Println with several commands.

0. cd to <strong>latlong</strong>

   It manages latitudes and longitudes in a map data type containing a key-value structure.

   * Uses float64 floating point number for latitude/longitude
   * Uses function to do repeated lookups

0. cd to <strong>utf8</strong> 

   It provides examples of counting and comparing Asian characters encoded in UTF-8.
   
   * Provides an illustration of fmt.Print() vs. fmt.Println() with escapted double-quotes.
   * Provides an example of using range.

0. cd to <strong>env-vars</strong> (in Git branch env-vars)


## Data Types

boolean constants are lower case: true, false

Numbers are not permitted at the start of an identifier (variable).

Go detects unused imports as an error.

Go has an array type, but most interactions are with slices which are built
off arrays. I don't worry too much about the name and just use them
The specification for slices are "[]T" where T is the type.
So "[]string" is a set of strings, "[]int" is a set of integers, and so on.


Conditionals: 

    <pre>
    var n int = 4
    var i = 0
    for i = 1; i < n; i++ {
        println(i)
    }
    </pre>

int is actually an alias!
Like C, Go has signed and unsigned integers:

   * int holds a maximum value of 32,000.
   * int8, 
   * int16, 
   * int32, 
   * int64


## UTF-8 Data Types

Alias <strong>rune</strong> are single-character constants: 'a', す', 'シ', '1', …

When working with unicode you should be converting your strings to []rune. 
That's why the utf8 package is so sparse, most things are covered by []rune conversion and the unicode package.
The utf8 package is like a very thin abstraction layer for using strings as []rune.

All source code in Go is UTF-8, so you can use an emoji, Japanese Kanji, or other language in variable names:

   <pre>
    var π = 3.14159
    var radius = 6371.0 // radius of the Earth in km
    var circumference = 2 * π * radius
&nbsp;
    println("Circumference of the earth is", circumference, "km")
   </pre>

   Run result in scientific notation:

   <pre>
   Circumference of the earth is +4.003014e+004 km
   </pre>

See https://coderwall.com/p/k7zvyg/dealing-with-unicode-in-go


## Developer Tools

0. Display documentation for the Println function within fmt:

   <pre>godoc fmt Println</pre>

   Println formats using the default formats for its operands and writes to
   standard output. Spaces are always added between operands and a newline
   is appended. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error encountered.

goimports, golint: code quality

Delve: debugger

glog, spew: logging

## Testing/Error Handling

assert: extended core testing capabilities to write tests more easily

errors: improved error handling


## Logic

if … { … } else { … }, switch { … }

   Heavily nested if else if blocks are discouraged.

for (init statement); condition; (post statement) { … }

   As Go is a strongly typed language, for two variables to be equal, both their type and their value must be equal.

while condition { … } and 

do { … } while condition

do { … } until condition

// TODO: Control flow: break, fallthrough, continue, goto, return.


0. cd to <strong>sync</strong> which uses Concurrency features.

   One of Go's biggest strengths is that the concurrency features it provides are 
   much easier to understand and use properly than threads and locks.

   Go has "goroutines" that are lightweight concurrency model based on coroutines.
   Goroutines do not use convoluted callback coding styles.

   The design of the Go language makes it work on multiple CPU cores.
   Go's language runtime makes sure that there are enough threads to keep cores active.


   ### Go's defer command.

   A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

   The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

   Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. 
   When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.

    <pre>
  fmt.Println("counting")
  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    defer fmt.Println(i)
  }
  fmt.Println("done")
    </pre>

    See https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover


## Web server

    err := http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
