This article shows those new to electronics how to install, configure, and use
the Intel Edison board and XDK IDE for simple projects.
Instructions are for Apple Mac.

{% include _intro.html %}

## IoT Hardware Basics #

Intel boards are based on Intel's <strong>X86</strong> architecture,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and 
Beaglebone are based on the alternative 3.3V ARM 11 chip architecture.

Intel boards do not have an HDMI video port like a Raspberry nor
keyboard port like on PCs.

The Galileo was Intel's initial board.
It does not have on-board WiFi.
It has the same form factor as the Edison board released in 2014.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY8kaaFzbTE

Both the Galileo and Edison have pinouts compatible with 5V <strong>Arduino</strong> boards,
so a shield such as Grove can be integrated. The Grove is a co

Intel Edison is a <strong>dual-core</strong> Silvermont Atom(TM) clocked at 500MHz. 
It's called a System on a Chip (SoC) because it packs so many capabilities:
4GB of storage (plus micro SD card slot), 1GB RAM

   NOTE: The Edison has on-board WiFi and Bluetooth, so cost $50 vs. $35 for the
   Arduino UNO which require additional hardware for WiFi and Bluetooth,
   but it has Analog I/O.

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/edison/sb/edisonarduino_hg_331191007.pdf">
   PDF: Hardware Guide: Intel® Edison Kit for Arduino</a>
   from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/000005583.html">
   here</a>
   contains a block diagram, header signal list, and other details.
   The board supports 40 GPIOs and includes 1 GB LPDDR3, 4 GB EMMC, and has dual-band WiFI and BTLE. 

   * The Intel® Edison kit for Arduino has a 100 mA charging current.

   * The Intel® Edison Breakout Board has a 190 mA charging current.

   PROTIP: The Edison runs 1.8V logic with current drive of 3mA. 
   (lower power than TTL or CMOS on other boards)
   Not enough to power an LED.

This Intel Arduino breakout also has an SD card connector, micro USB or standard sized 

Intel also has a Mini Breakout board.

Intel's Gateway</a> is hardware and software that collects data from IoT devices
for aggregation in a cloud service, which provides analytics.


## First project #

* <a href="#SampleEmbeddedApp">
   Blink an on-board LED</a> does not require additional items.
   So this "embedded app" project is a good first project to get familiar with the basics working.

* Follow instructions <a target="_blank" href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-a-temperature-monitoring-app">here</a> to 
   create a temperature monitoring app using Intel® XDK
   receiving temperature from a sensor connected via a Grove* Cable
   plugged into a Grove Base Shield.

## Connect power #

0. CAUTION: Discharge static before you touch anything.

0. Handle PCB (Printed Circult Boards) by the edges.

0. The switch on the top edge of the board should be toggled to 5V.

0. The switch among the plugs (1 in the diagram) should be toggled to whatever side is plugged in.

   PROTIP: It's best to power your Intel® Edison board with the <strong>external</strong> DC power supply, 
   with the round barrel connector (4 on the diagram).

   PROTIP: However, plug in a USB cable from a USB 3.0 port on your host computer (laptop)
   to the middle USB connector on the board to provide current to drive the <strong>LCD display</strong>.

   <amp-img alt="intel edison board power ports 496x235-i26.png" width="496" height="235" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17610773/ab54adfc-5ffe-11e6-86b8-5d24cc60f978.png"></amp-img>

0. Slide the micro-switch "SW1" (multiplexer USB 2.0 OTG interface) 
   toward the USB Type micro-B (the small one that goes into mobile phones) to select 
   <strong>device mode</strong>.

   Slide the micro-switch toward the larger USB Type A recepticle for 
   to select <strong>device mode</strong> operation.

### Remote operation #

It is possible to have the Edison operate remotely off solar and battery power.
A battery is needed evenings and on cloudy days.

Sparkfun.com has this set of components:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13037">
   LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery</a>.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12885">
   $25 SparkFun Sunny Buddy - MPPT Solar Charger</a> (maximum power point tracking) controller
   has a port from of solar panel supplying from 6V to 20V.
   Its maximum charge current is 450mA.

   (rocketscream boards is an alternative)

   It receives input power via its barrow connector __?

* Solar panels for this include the 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5036-010/SolarGorilla-5V-to-20V-Solar-Panel-Charger">
   $265 SolarGorilla</a>


## Connect to PC #

The Edison board provides several ways to move data.

There are several build-in commands that can be used to connect your PC to the board,
described below.
If you <a href="#BloopInstall">installed Bloop</a>, connect with a single utility command:

   <tt><strong>
   bloop c
   </strong></tt>

   This automatically connects you via "screen" to an attached Edison device.


   <a name="BloopInstall"></a>

   ### Install Bloop #

   https://www.npmjs.com/package/bloop<br />
   is a set of command-line tools for working with Intel Edison on the PC (laptop) side.

0. Install bloop globally:

   <tt><strong>
   npm install -g bloop
   </strong></tt>

   The response:

   <pre>
/usr/local/Cellar/node/6.3.0/bin/bloop -> /usr/local/Cellar/node/6.3.0/lib/node_modules/bloop/bloop.js
/usr/local/Cellar/node/6.3.0/lib
└─┬ bloop@0.1.3 
  ├── commander@2.5.1 
  └─┬ promptly@0.2.1 
    └─┬ read@1.0.7 
      └── mute-stream@0.0.6 
   </pre>

   <a target="_blank" href="http://rexstjohn.com/introducing-bloop-cli-commands-for-working-with-intel-edison/">
   Read about its commands</a> from its creator Rex St. John (@rexstjohn)

   BLAH: After install, I got a "command not found".
   So we're sticking with built-in commands below.


   ### Serial connection #

0. Connect a USB cable to the micro-USB port at 2 on the diagram.

   <amp-youtube data-videoid="mTR3EDKVp9w" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270"></amp-youtube>
   by Intel Evangelist <a target="_blank" href="http://evangelists.intel.com/bio/Daniel_Holmlund">
   Daniel Holmlund</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/agnathan">@agnathan</a>) 

   Alternately, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-efF7-Utte0">
   for Windows</a>

   PROTIP: On a Mac, plug in BOTH mico-USB cables.

0. Open a Terminal shell window.
   Alternately, take the manual approach:

0. List UART devices connected on  /dev/ttyMFD1.

   <tt><strong>
   ls /dev/tty.*
   </strong></tt>

   The response is like:

   <pre>
   /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port	/dev/tty.usbserial-A90400YX
   </pre>

   NOTE: The "A90400YX" in this example will be different on your device.

0. Highlight and copy the part such as “/dev/tty.usbserial-A90400YX”
   and paste to assemble this command:

   <tt><strong>
   screen /dev/tty.usbserial-A90400YX 115200 -L
   </strong></tt>

   * The `115200` specifies the "baud" speed of communications
   (the highest theorectical maximum of 230,400 bits per second).

   * The `-L` flag turns on output logging.
   <br /><br />

   TROUBLESHOOTING: 
   If "Sorry, cannot find a PTY", try closing the terminal,
   open another terminal, power down the board, and bring it up again.

0. Press Enter when the blank terminal appears.<br />
   Press Enter twice for the Edison board.

   The response should be something like this:

   <pre>
Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro) 1.7.3 edison ttyMFD2
&nbsp;
edison login: 
   </pre>

   NOTE: The "edison" above is the name of the board setup before.

0. Type <strong>root</strong>. There is no other user name on the Edison.

   A new board would have no password.

0. If a password prompt appears, one was specified by a previous user.
   If you don't know the password, flash the firmware again (see below).

   Sucess is this line (but instead of "edison", your user name would appear):

   <pre>
   root@edison:~# _
   </pre>

   Skip to <a href="#BoardVersion">verify version</a>
   or <a href="#mraainstall">MRAA install</a>.

   PROTIP: When exiting from a screen session, press Ctrl + D to detach cleanly.


## Firmware download # 

PROTIP: The device you have may have obsolete firmwware.

DEFINITION:
Firmware is the operating system of embedded microcontrollers. 

Flashing is the process of overwriting the firmware on the board's memory, 
much like applying system updates on your computer.



### Mac El Capitan #

I wasted several days scratching my head until I finally tweeted 
<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/inteliot/">@inteliot</a> and
(my hero) Rex St. John (who also wrote bloop)

* Even though Intel does not provide an IDE for the Python programming language,
   a Python interpreter comes preinstalled on the board, 
   plus there is Python support in the sensor library:

### Node-RED #

Applications doing M2M (Mobile to Mobile) 
can be created using the drag-and-drop UI from
<a target="_blank" href="https://nodered.org/">
nodered.org</a>. 
The program was written in NodeJs,
and export JSON blocks called the
"Node-RED" visual programming language.

It's supported by Intel, Samsung.

### Types of apps #

* Internet of Things <a href="#EmbeddedApps">
embedded apps</a> are mobile apps that executes on a real mobile device
(such as a smart phone or tablet)
interacting with users and onboard sensors on the mobile device.

   Onboard sensors on mobile devices include accelerometer, geo location, etc.

* <strong>Web apps</strong> on a mobile device have users open a <strong>web browser</strong> 
   and require internet access for execution on a web server.
   These are also called "HTML5" apps for the format of web pages displayed by web apps.
   These apps are invoked by specifying a URL on the web browser rather than
   clicking on an app icon on the mobile device.

* <strong>Hybrid apps</strong> are called hybrid because users open such apps by downloading them
   from the Google Play store, but the app executes within a web app window.
   The <strong>Cordova</strong> library enables JavaScript to access onboard sensors.
   Such apps are generally slower than real apps.

## Embedded apps #

The code base for embedded apps consists of <strong>JavaScript</strong>
which executes on a Node.js runtime on the board.

It requires an IoT maker board and is not built like mobile web apps for phones and tablets.

This approach requires these libraries:

## Temp sensor on shield #

Let's look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Temperature_Sensor">
   SeeedStudio's wiki on the Temp sensor</a>.

   Note that the Voltage is "3.3 - 5V".

   To make use of sensors, we'll need that shield from the Grove Kit.
   It's designed so we don't have to solder anything.

0. PROTIP: Make it a habit to discarge static before touching any electronics.

0. PROTIP: Disconnect power to the board before you
   insert the Grove shield on top of the Edison board.

   The green LED should now be lit.

0. Use the 4-pin grove cable to connect the temperature sensor to 
   port <strong>A0</strong> on the Grove shield.

   ### XDK new project # 

0. If you are using XDK, create a new project file. 

0. Select Templates, Local Temperature, Continue.

0. Specify the project name as the folder name. OK.

   Notice "Read Temperature Sensor and send temperature in degrees of Fahrenheit every 4 seconds".

   A console.log statement sends a reading "Analog Pin (A0) Output: " and
   "Fahrenheit Temperature: " + fahrenheit_temperature);

   ### Edit program #

0. If four seconds (4000) is too frequent a reporting period, 
   change it to <strong>30000</strong> (30 seconds).

0. Click the download icon.

   ### Debugging #

0. Next, send the temperature value to a cloud for analysis and analytics.

## Support Serial Numbers #

For support, contact
<a target="_blank" href="https://customercare.intel.com/?lang=en-US">
https://customercare.intel.com/?lang=en-US</a>. For product, type in "Intel Edison" to 
select "Intel Edison Compute Module (IoT)".

The form asks for the serial number from the tiny tag below the metal chip cover 
(such as "FZEDA 616D 01Q5B 501").

<a target="_blank" href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-ap-mode-for-intel-edison-board">
This page</a> shows how to get the serial number by placing the board in AP (Access Point) mode.

0. On your board, hold down the button labeled PWR for 4 seconds (no more than 2 seconds but no longer than 7 seconds). The LED at JS2 near the center of the board should blink and remain blinking as long as your board is in AP mode.

<a target="_blank" href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/57093">
This post</a> offers an iotdk eclipse program to show programs
to get the FPO number and ATPO number unique to each specific processor.
