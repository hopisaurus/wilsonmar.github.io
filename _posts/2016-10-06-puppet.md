This article currently contains my notes about installing and using Puppet.

<a name="Competitors"></a>
## Competitors to Puppet #

Puppet is used to automate a way to ensure that all servers have consistent configuration.
was created in 2005 by Luke Kanies.
Commercialization began in 2011
at <a target="_blank" href="https://puppet.com/">puppet.com</a>.

Also in the configuration management software market:

* SaltStack Enterprise
* Enterprise Chef (requires Ruby skills)
* Ansible 
* CF Engine (first relased 1993)

In 2016, Puppet is seeing customers move to Ansible.
But Puppet skills are still in demand.


Puppet can do this across different versions of different operating systems!
This is possible because Puppet <strong>manifest</strong> files are declarative in that they 
specify the configuration desired (the "what"),
whereas server shell scripts are more complicated since they specify <strong>procedural</strong> (the "how"),
which differ for different operating systems.


## Local Installation #

https://Virtualbox.org/wiki/downloads

https://www.VagrantUp.com/downloads.html


## Linux installs #

0. Install an Apache web server on Ubuntu:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install apache2
   ```

   On Redhat:

   ```
   sudo yum install httpd
   yum repolist
   ```

0. Puppet install on CentOS:

   ```
   sudo yum install puppet-agent #CentOS
   sudo apt-get install puppet-agent 
   sudo rpm -Uvh \
   https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-e1-7-noarch.rpm
   ```

   Puppet 4 introduced Puppet-collections to ensure that dependency packages such as
   heira, facter, and ruby are consistent to a given Puppet version.

   On Ubuntu, "trusty" is the code name for the 14.04 Debian repo:

   ```
   wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
   sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

0. Puppet all-in-one client install (without the -y to see dependencies):

   ```
   sudo yum install puppet-agent #CentOS
   sudo apt-get install puppet-agent #Ubuntu
   ```

## Config #

0. Verify on any platform:

   ```
   puppet agent --version
   ```

   Instead of printing all values, specify specific values:

   ```
   puppet config print certname
   puppet config print { confdir rundir  ssldir  vardir  runinterval }
   ```

   NOTE: The default environmenttimeout is 5 minutes when a server is checked for changes.

   The runinterval default is 1800 (30 minutes).

   confdir yields where the conf directory is (changed from "puppet" in v3):

   ```
   /etc/puppetlabs/puppet
   ```

   vardir yields where the variable directory is (changed from v3):

   ```
   /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache
   ```

0. PROTIP: Add in the path within your bash profile file symlinks to folder:

   ```
   <strong>/opt/puppetlabs/bin</strong>
   ```

   the symlinks resolve to:

   ```
   /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin
   ```

   Direct editing takes a few less microseconds to run (and faster to read)
   than checking every time:

   ```
   if ! echo $PATH | grep -q /opt/puppetlabs/bi ; then
      export PATH=$PATH:/opt/puppetlabs/bin
   fi
   ```

0. Edit secure_path in visudo file:

   ```
   sudo visudo
   ```

   Add to end:

   ```
   secure_path=/sbin:/bin/:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin<strong>:/opt/puppetlabs/bin</strong>
   ```

## Resources #


0. For an individual's information:

   ```
   sudo puppet resource user bob
   ```

0. Pipe status info about a service to a manifest file:

   ```
   sudo puppet resource service puppet > puppet-service.pp
   ```

   the response in the file is:

   ```
   service { 'puppet':
     ensure => 'stopped',
     enable => 'false',
   }
   ```

 0. Pipe the status info to a manifest file:

   PROTIP: Like Ansible, Puppet configurations are <strong>idempotent</strong>
   (a combination of two Latin words "idem" = the same and "potent"=power),
   meaning that the same script runs several times will result in the same result.
   Something not created will be created when the job runs.
   Something created already will not result in a "already exists" error.

<strong> Resource declarations</strong> are text files ending in <strong>.pp</strong>.
The Puppet Apply program reads such files.


They specify each node's
Type (Package, File, or Service) , Title (such as 'ntp'), 
Attributes/Parameters, Provider:

```
node 'appserver01' {
  package { 'ntp':
    ensure => 'installed';
  }
  file { '/etc/readme.txt':
    ensure  => 'present',
    content => "This file.",
  }
  file { 'Readme':
    ensure  => 'present',
    content => "This file.",
    path => "/etc/readme.txt",
  }
  service { 'ntpd':
    ensure  => 'running',
    enable  => true,
  }
}
```

0. List available resources:

   ```
   sudo puppet describe --list
   ```

<a name="ServiceStart"></a>

## Start service #

   ```
   systemctl start puppet
   ```

   Then:

   ```
   sudo puppet apply puppet-service.pp
   ```

<a name="Manifests"></a>

## Manifests Declaration #

Text files ending in <strong>.pp</strong> are Puppet
<strong>manifest declarations</strong> 
read by the Puppet Apply program.

0. Create a "hello world" manifest

0. To validate:

   ```
   sudo puppet parser validate puppet-service.pp
   ```

0. To run dynamically, instead of a .pp file:

   ```
   sudo puppet apply -e "notify { 'Hello world!' : }"
   ```

   Example responses are rather verbose:

   ```
   Notice: Compiled catalog for centos7 in environment production in 0.05 seconds
   Notice: Hello world!
   Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Notify[Hello world!]/message: defined 'message' as 'Hellow world!'
   Notice: Applied catalog in 0.05 seconds
   ```


0. To view the last file:

   ```
   cat !$
   ```

   PROTIP: See <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.puppet.com/guides/style_guide.html">
   Puppet's Style Guide</a>

<a name="Modules"></a>

##  Puppet Module #

0. Puppet modules in module forge.

0. Install a custom module:

   ```
   sudo puppet module install theurbanpenguin/puppet_vim
   include puppet_vim
   ```

0. What modules have been installed?

   ```
   sudo puppet module list
   ```

   These are storred in:

   ```
   /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
   ```


<a name="PuppetMaster"></a>

##  PuppetMaster Server #

A PuppetMaster server, a Ruby on Rails app running on Linux (Centos).

When working in the cloud, many are moving away from PuppetMaster servers
but still using Puppet server definition files.

Each node runs an agent which can be Unix (BSD and Mac OSX), even Windows.

Nodes connect to the PM over <strong>port 8140</strong>.

The master creates and maintains a catalog of nodes.

The facter collects facts from each node (OS, CPU, network, block devices, etc.).
