This section contains my notes on Ansible Tower Mission Control at
https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works


The name Ansible is from the movie Enders Game for the device Ender used to communicate with others galaxies away in real-time.

Michael DeHaan (RedHat) created Ansible on his spare time.

## Ansible Control Server #

* Requires Python 2.6+ (not 3.0)
* Runs on *NIX (Linux/Unix/Mac) - Windows not supported nor recommended.

A wide variety of <strong>remote servers</strong> are made manageable by <strong>modules</strong>
written to work with Anisible.

   * Simplejson library on *NIX.
   * Windows Remote PowerShell 2.0 enabled.

Modules are the "brains" of Ansible.

Playbooks are the "glue" of the system.
It uses .yml files, each called a <strong>play</strong> one or a set of tasks.

An <strong>Inventory</strong> is like the hosts file for Ansible.

An Ansible Config define Ansible control server configuration.

## Features #

   * Provisioning - transitioning one system state to another. Ansible installs packages each time rather than using a stored image.
   * Automation
   * Orchestration
   * Change management

Ansible works by definitions of <strong>desired state</strong> - a "model" of the IT infrastructure.
It's like providing the destination address rather than directions to that location.

Ansible evaluates to mark changed states.

A function is Idempotent if repeated applications has the same affect as a single application.

### Steps during provisioning #

   0. Install OS 
   0. Install software
   0. Copy configurations
   0. Copy web files
   0. Install security updates
   0. Start web server
