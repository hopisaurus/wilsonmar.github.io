The object of this tutorial is to succintly present, with step-by-step instructions but without much marketing hype,
how to make use of Ansible.

Ansible is open-sourced under the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansible/">
github.com/ansible</a> organization on GitHub.
The repo is among the top 10 Python projects.
The GitHub Octoverse report for 2013 featured Ansible as being #5 on the list of open source projects with the most contributors. 

Its documentation is at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/">
ansible.com</a>.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/ansible">@ansible Twitter account</a>
is titled "Red Hat Ansible" because it's initiating author,
<a target="_blank" href="http://michaeldehaan.net/">
Michael DeHaan</a> from North Carolina (@laserllama),
began writing Ansible in his spare time while working at RedHat.
Quotes from his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OiiaUgXrlE">
lightning talk at All Things Open Dec 3, 2014</a>:

   * "Your IT infrastructure should be boring"
   * "How do we get sysadmins and developers together to cheat off each other, even at competing companies"
   * "Automation should not be your day job"
   * "Build early and often. Build a culture of testing."
   * "Have Dev/QA/Stage environments that mirror production to see what can go wrong early."

## How Ansible works #

<amp-img width="650" height="408" alt="ansible-overview-v01" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15453893/f9c22a7e-1fe3-11e6-9da7-5ea080789559.jpg"></amp-img>

The name "ansible" is popularized by the science-fiction book and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game_%28film%29"> movie 
Enders Game</a>
which uses a device to communicate with many ships galaxies away, in real-time.

Ansible's <strong>Control Server</strong> (acs)
is what communicates with many remote servers to download and provision software locally in them.

   Communication is via SSH (secure shell) connections.
   So one does not need to beg for special ports to be opened through the enterprise firewall.

   But <strong>plug-ins</strong> can enable communications via ZeroMQ (fireball mode) or other means.

By default, JSON messages are communicated back to the Control Server.
(Internally, Ansible uses the Django-REST framework, PyYAML, Jinja2, the template engine for Python)


### .yml files in Git vs. database #

Instead of a database server, Ansible stores declarations in text files of <strong>yml</strong> (yamil) format
that are both human machine readable, called <strong>Playbooks</strong>,
which can be edited by any <strong>text editor</strong>.

Playbooks can be based on contributions from the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/explore#/">
Ansible Galaxy</a> community website.

Being text files, most enterprises put Ansible configuration files in a 
<strong>Git repository</strong> (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) so changes can be managed.

Ansible reads declarations of <strong>desired state</strong>
rather than imperative programming commands (to do this and that in a specified sequence),

   It's like when you get in a taxi and you provide a destination address rather than directions to that location.

   This makes definitions more reusable.

Plays contain <strong>tasks</strong> which are carried out by <strong>modules</strong> within the server.

Modules can apply plays on several servers defined in an <a href="#InventoryFile">inventory</a> file
which can be dynamically generated from a CMDB (Configuration Management DataBase)
cataloguing assets in AWS, Azure, GCP, or private cloud.


### Galaxy of sample configurations #

0. Use an internet browser to <a target="_blank" href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/explore#/">
galaxy.ansible.com/explore</a>

0. Search.
0. Open a sample playbook. ???

   Playbooks are defined in .yml files, which begin with three dashes in the first line.

   Playbooks define <strong>plays</strong>. consisting of one or a set of <strong>tasks</strong>.

   <strong>tasks</strong> invoke modules.

   Tasks trigger handlers which are run once at the end of plays.


An Ansible Config define Ansible control server configuration.

Notice the repos downloaded more than anyone is from 
@geerlingguy, Jeff Geerling (http://www.jeffgeerling.com/) 
has been using Ansible to manage infrastructure since early 2013, and
wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ansiblefordevops.com/">ansiblefordevops.com</a>

Encrypted data within playbooks stored in GitHub can be unencrypted in memory using 
<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html">
Ansible Vault</a>.


## Roles #

<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks-roles.html">
Roles</a>
are self-contained with tasks, variables, configuration templates, etc.
 
<pre>
roles/
  webserver/
    tasks/
    handlers/
    files/
    templates/
    defaults/
    vars/
    meta/
</pre>

## Prerequisites #

Ansible Control Server core is written in Python 2.6+ (not 3.0).
Thus, it can run natively on *NIX (Linux/Unix/Mac) - Windows not currently supported nor recommended.

However, you can run virtual instances on a Windows, Mac, or other native OS.

### Setup Vagrant and Virtualbox #

0. Download and install:

   * A virtual image manager from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vagrantUp.com/">VagrantUp.com</a> (87.9 MB for vagrant_1.8.1.dmg).
   * A vm provider (hypervisor) to run virtual machines from Oracle's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">
    VirtualBox</a>

    &nbsp;

0. Verify availability from a command-line Terminal:

   <tt><strong>
   vagrant<br />
   vboxmanager
   </strong></tt>

0. Create a folder (of any name) for Ansible configuration files. 
   This is typically for a project.
   This can be in a git folder if you'd like version management.

   <tt><strong>
   cd ~<br />
   mkdir ansible<br />
   cd ansible
   </strong></tt>

   The ~ (tilde character above) refers to your home folder.

0. Switch to an internet browser to open a repository of Vagrant server base images:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vagrantcloud.com/">
   http://vagrantcloud.com</a>
   (which redirects to a site owned by hashicorp, who owns Vagrant, thus the advert for the Atlas licensed product)

   NOTE: Many enterprises instead use an internal repository.

0. In the box under "Discover Vagrant Boxes", search for <strong>ubuntu</strong> or CentOS, etc.

0. Choose one and copy its text in blue, such as "nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64" from contributor nrel or "ubuntu/trusty64".

0. Close down any process making use of port 8080, as that's Vagrant's default port.
   (Jenkins also uses port 8080 by default)

0. Initialize a Vagrantfile for use by Vagrant:

   <tt><strong>vagrant init</strong></tt>
   
   Sample response:

   <pre>
   A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
   ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
   the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
   `vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
   </pre>

0. If you have a file named <strong>Vagrantfile</strong> from another source, 
   copy it into the folder to replace the file generated.

   Alternately, open a text editor to create a file name <strong>Vagrantfile</strong>
    in end up with this sample content to specific the acs (Ancible Control Server),
   web, and db servers:

   {% highlight text %}
   Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|

     config.vm.define "acs" do |acs|
       acs.vm.box = "nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64"
       acs.vm.hostname = "acs"
       acs.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
     end

     config.vm.define "web" do |web|
       web.vm.box="nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64"
       web.vm.hostname = "web"
       web.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.20"
       web.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
     end

     config.vm.define "db" do |db|
       db.vm.box = "nrel/CentOS-6.5-x86_64"
       db.vm.hostname = "db"
       db.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.30"
     end 
   end
  {% endhighlight %}

  Names between \| (pipe) characters provide handles to identify each server.

  Two spaces are used to indent.

  Internal IP addresses (192.168.33.xxx) are used in this example.

  Change 8080 to another port if it is already used by another process on your computer.

### Vagrant up #

0. Bring up machines based on Vagrantfile specifications:

   <tt><strong>
   vagrant up
   </strong></tt>

   This can take several minutes, or even hours
   if this is the first time since images for servers specified need to be downloaded.


0. Switch to a Finder to see that a <strong>.vagrant</strong> (hidden) folder has been added.
   Under the <strong>machines</strong> folder is a folder for each type specified between pipe characters (acs, web, db, etc).

0. Open another terminal shell to check what is running:

   <tt><strong>
   vboxmanage list runningvms
   </strong></tt>

   The response is a hash:

   {% highlight text %}
   "ansible_acs_1463860205025_4852" {128ce450-8384-4adb-a4fd-7f4ac5c1f0b8}
   "ansible_web_1463862332570_44406" {dd044db3-ecf1-4b9b-9c42-96952172bd4d}
   "ansible_db_1463882256962_22323" {411c8704-f220-4188-8b94-d1bfb093e1b4}
   {% endhighlight %}

### Provision Ansible Control Server #

0. SSH into the acs server via vagrant:

   <tt><strong>vagrant ssh acs</strong></tt>

   This takes several seconds to connect.

   This adds the ey to the known_hosts file within the .ssh folder for future reference.

0. When you're done:

   <tt><strong>
   exit
   </strong></tt>

0. Use a package manager to download bits. On a CentOS or RHEL server:

   <tt><strong>sudo yum -y install ansible</strong></tt>

   Alternately, on a Debian Ubuntu server:

   <tt><strong>sudo apt-get -y install ansible</strong></tt>

   Notice the log says Python is installed as well.

0. Verify:

   <tt><strong>ansible \-\-version</strong></tt>


   ### Provision web server #

0. SSH into the web server via vagrant:

   <tt><strong>vagrant ssh web</strong></tt>

0. Use a package manager to download bits:

   <tt><strong>sudo yum -y install epel-release</strong></tt>

### Install by Compiling Source Code #

0. Install C compiler used with Python:

   <tt><strong>sudo yum install gcc</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo yum install python-setuptools</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo easy_install pip</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo yum install python-devel</strong></tt>

   <tt><strong>sudo pip install ansible</strong></tt>

## Updates #

Ansible achieves zero-downtime deployments with
multi-tear rolling updates to each specific node in a cluster.

This specifies taking 5 machines at a time out of a cluster:

   <pre>
   - hosts: webservers
     serial: 5

   pre_tasks:

   - name: take out of load balancer pool
     local_action: command /usr/bin/take_out_of_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}

  roles:
   - common
   - webserver
   - monitored

  post_tasks:
   - name: add back to load balancer pool
     local_action: command /usr/bin/add_back_to_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
   </pre>


## Tasks #

<strong>tasks</strong> are executed from command line terminals.

They are shereable and repeatable.




## Install sample environment #

Install:


Ansible covers more functionality:

   * Provisioning - install software, patch security, copy files in, customize configurations, start web service.
   * Change management of configurations with configuration remediation.
   * Automation - make decisions. A single change can impact several machines.
   * Complex Orchestration of dependencies.

Ansible evaluates to mark changed states.

A function is Idempotent if repeated applications has the same affect as a single application.


<a name="InventoryFile"></a>

### Inventory file #

An example:

   <pre>
   [webservers]
   192.168.33.20
   192.168.33.30

   [db]
   db-a.example.com
   
   [lbservers]
   lbserver
   
   [monitoring]
   nagios
   </pre>

To get the status of servers under [webservers] in the inventory file above:

   <tt><strong>
   ansible webservers -m ping 
   </strong></tt>

In addition to this ad-hoc run, Ansible can be run based on the contents of Playbooks with a command such as:

   <tt><strong>
   ansible-playbook <em>file.yml</em>
   </strong></tt>

Additionally, licensed product <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ansible.com/tower">
Ansible Tower</a>
runs playbooks for enterprises.

Next, let's look at examples of some Ansible playbook files.

### Modules in various languages #

Unlike Puppet, Ansible does not require agents to be installed and 
thus potentially leave residual bits on servers.

Various <strong>modules</strong> running on remote hosts
provide the plumbing for other networking protocols, such as HTTP, runing on remote machines.

   Modules are the "brains" of Ansible.

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/modules_by_category.html">
List of available modules</a>.

Responses returned to the Ansible Control Server are in JSON messages.

Module development can be in any dynamic language, not just Python on the server.

   * Simplejson library on *NIX.
   * Windows Remote PowerShell 2.0 enabled.

Modules (hopefully written by following <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/developing_modules.html#testing-modules">
Module Development Guide</a>)
can be selected from various sources:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core">
   ansible-modules-core</a> are writtin Python.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras">
   ansible-modules-extras</a>
   developed by others have slightly lower use or priority.

Server-side modules (action plugins)

## Playbooks #

Play behavior can be controlled several ways:
   with_items, failed_when, changed_when, until, ignore_errors

### Steps during provisioning #

   0. Install OS 
   0. Install software
   0. Copy configurations
   0. Copy web files
   0. Install security updates
   0. Start web server

The precedence Ansible looks for configuration <strong>variables</strong>.
(stop searching once it finds one):

   0. **$ANSIBLE_CONFIG** environment variable
   0. **./ansible_cfg** in current directory
   0. **~/ansible.cfg** (home directory of currently logged in account)
   0. **/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg** global config. file

An example $ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable 
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html">
from the full list</a> is:

   $ANSIBLE_FORKS=5

   This sets the maximum number of parallel operations allowed on an Ansible server,
   determined through performance and capacity testing.
