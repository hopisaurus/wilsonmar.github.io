This video shows the sequence of commands to a "Git Flow" workflow 
for someone with a Git command-line client installed and want to work on a Git repository she cannot directly update.

Before watching this, see ...

## Video

This illustrates the basic Git commands for using Git to interact with GitHub repositories. 
Items are revealed gradually with narration in the video:

## Narrative (captioning)

Here we have some stranger's repository in GitHub which we have no rights to edit. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities</a>

But if you <strong>fork</strong> it into your own GitHub account, you would then have rights to change it.

To work with repositories on your local machine, install a Git client. 
Its installation includes adding in your user home folder a dot git folder containing a config file. That file stores git global commands such as username and userid settings for attribution. 

   This tutorial is called "Git workflow" because it makes use of a Git client on your local machine.

Git commands are typed into a Terminal shell window on a Mac or a Run command window on Windows. Most IDEs incorporate commonly used Git client functionality into their software.

### Clone

PROTIP: I recommend that you create an account folder to hold all your various repositories. 
Be in that folder when you clone a repository from GitHub. 
Git then creates that repo's folder and within it a folder named dot git to hold objects that track changes to the repository.

During cloning, Git automatically extracts files from objects out to the repository's folder, 
as if you typed a git checkout of the default branch. 

   Add <tt>-recursive</tt> to pull in sub-modules (repositories stored within the repository).

Now we cd into the repository folder.

### Branch list

A <strong>git branch</strong> command shows us all the branches held in the repository. 

   The -avv provides more detail.

PROTIP: Git defaults to the master branch. But many organizations protect that name for production use, and instead create a “development” or “dev” branch for developers to work with.

The git checkout command controls what Git extracts out from the repository database to the repository's folder. 

### New branch

The dash b specifies creation of a new branch, such as "feature1", to associate new changes.

   PROTIP: Atlassian defines its branches<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SoB3TFkjA&t=18m26s">*</a> 
   with a type (feature, bugfix, hotfix, etc.), a slash, an issue number, then a short description.

   ![git atlassian branch naming 650x222](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/25307644/7de0e70a-2772-11e7-8b3c-f4a57f091f51.png)

   The advantage of creating a branch is that <strong>parallel development</strong>
   can occur without risking the master branch.

   Unlike Subversion, all files are available for change with a Git branch.

### Editing

Now we can edit the file named README.md. The md designates markdown format. 
Such a file GitHub creates with this specific name to describe each repository.

We can use vim or another text editor (such as nano, atom, etc.) to change contents inside files. 
Batch files would echo text to the bottom of the file.

### Status

The <strong>git status</strong> command details the status of changes to the repo. 

   This command is used so often that many create an operating system level alias such as "gs".

### Add

You can change several files, but only the files you add to <strong>Git's staging area</strong> will be pushed to GitHub. 

The dot selects all files changed. The dash capital A parameter specifies that deleted files be processed. But many prefer to specifically add individual files to go into each particular commit, which works on all files added to staging. 

   Alternately, "git add -u" added all the files modified (not new files created and untracked).

### Commit

The commit supplies a message describing changes, which applies to all files added. 

   If you don't specify the dash m, Git will display a file containing comments as a prompt.
   Any line beginning with the # comment character will be ignored and not be part of the comment.

### Log

The <strong>git log</strong> command provides a history of all commits. It has lots of options, so to avoid typing all the parameters desired, most people define an alias of the command in git's config file.

   List a count of changes in each file in the commit (for example, abcdef1) with<br />
   <pre>git log --stat abcdef1</pre>. 

<strong>git reflog</strong> lists actions that have occurred on the local machine.

### Rebasing

Before pushing to GitHub, some prefer to rebase to squash some commits so that only one commit message appears for several commits made. 

   Rebasing cleans up intermediate commits that is unwanted noise to the rest of the team.
   The extra commits complicates the history, and makes back-out of code more difficult.

   Yes, this changes history, which is why we do it. But it's only on your local version.

### Push

The git push command sends to a remote what has been committed for a specific branch. 
If you didn't paste your public key into GitHub, you would get an error now.

Because branches are just markers within Git, once a feature branch is in GitHub, that branch can be deleted from the local repo and from GitHub (by specifying that colon in front of the branch name). 

Unless you have been designated a committer in the upstream repository, you can't push changes to it. But you can request their committers to pull changes from your forked repo. When a committer of that repo merges (or in other words, accepts) your PR, you'll get an email from GitHub.

Next, let's look at what happens if, over time, changes occur in the upstream repo. The git remote –verification command tells us that the origin remote was created, as usual, with the repo. To enable dowload by Git, we add the upstream remote. 

To obtain changes locally, many would rather NOT issue a git pull upstream command, which blindly fetches and automatically merges changes. Differences in the same line within the same file, Git is forced into automatic conflict resolution mode.

### gitk for diff

So many prefer to take it one step at a time -- first a git fetch upstream, then a git checkout master. Now we can use a utility such as gitk to see what changes came in. If they don't affect you, do a git merge. Notice the slash separator. Use a cat or less command to verify file contents. 

   Click the commit listed at the top, which is the most recent commit.

Lastly, we git push to update origin master on our forked repository.

There are variations to these commands, but this is the typical workflow.

   * Hotfix from master and back to master
   * Bugfix
   * Feature
   * Release
   * Support

There is a helper software to use instead of git commands:

   * <tt>git-flow hotfix finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git-flow feature finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git-flow release finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
