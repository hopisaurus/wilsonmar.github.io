This is for someone with a Git command-line client installed.

<!-- Before watching this, see ...
-->

Watch the video below (a few times) to understand the sequence of commands in Git and GitHub.

Then actually type out the commands shown in the Narrative below, 
which provides additional alternatives not shown in the video.

Then, consider installing the multi-branch "Git-flow" software for enterprise teams.

## Video

Items are revealed gradually with narration in the video:

PROTIP: Print <a href="#Recap">this picture</a> and pin it on a wall for reference.

## Narrative (captioning)

<a name="HandsOn"></a>

Let's get hands-on typing each of the commands in the sequence presented in the video.

### Fork

Here we have some stranger's repository in GitHub which we have no rights to edit. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities">
   https://github.com/wilsonmar/git-utilities</a>

But if you <strong>fork</strong> it into your own GitHub account, you would then have rights to change it.

### Git client

To work with repositories on your local machine, install a Git client. 
Its installation includes adding in your user home folder a dot git folder containing a config file. 
That file stores git global commands such as username and userid settings for attribution. 

   * The "global" should be "--global". This will be corrected in a future version of the video.

   * This tutorial is called "Git workflow" because it makes use of a Git client on your local machine.

### Terminal

Git commands are typed into a Terminal shell window on a Mac or a Run command window on Windows. Most IDEs incorporate commonly used Git client functionality into their software. 

   * For example, in Eclipse, right-click on the project, then select 
   <strong>Team</strong> for the Git menu:
   ![git eclipse menu 518x648](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/25332307/ebf39f84-28b3-11e7-9d3b-5132a549cf13.png)

   * Return to this picture after going through this course to see if you recognize what each GUI item does.

### Clone in account folder

PROTIP: I recommend that you create an account folder to hold all your various repositories. 

Be in that folder when you clone a repository from GitHub. 

Git then creates that repo's folder and within it a folder named dot git to hold objects that track changes to the repository.

During cloning, Git automatically extracts files from objects out to the repository's folder, 
as if you typed a git checkout of the default branch. 

   * Add parameter <tt>--recursive</tt> to pull in sub-modules (repositories stored within the repository).

   * Add parameter <tt>--depth=1</tt> to only clone the latest version, to save disk space locally by
   not having previous version history on your machine.

Now we cd into the repository folder.

### Branch list

A <strong>git branch</strong> command shows us all the branches held in the repository. 

   * The <tt>-avv</tt> parameter provides more detail. Dash a specifies remote tracking branches to appear as well.

   * PROTIP: Create an operating-system alias "gb" by adding in .bash_profile <pre>alias gb='git branch -avv'</pre>
   then open up a new Terminal shell window to rerun the profile.

PROTIP: Git defaults to the master branch. But many organizations protect that name for production use, and instead create a “development” or “dev” branch for developers to work with.

### git checkout

The git checkout command controls what Git extracts out from the repository database to the repository's folder. 

   * If you add a file after the git checkout command, Git will replace the file in the working folder with the version in 
   the committed repository.


### New branch

The dash b specifies creation of a new branch, such as "feature1", to associate new changes.

   * PROTIP: Atlassian defines its branches<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SoB3TFkjA&t=18m26s">*</a> 
   with a type (feature, bugfix, hotfix, etc.), a slash, an issue number, then a short description.

   ![git atlassian branch naming 650x222](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/25307644/7de0e70a-2772-11e7-8b3c-f4a57f091f51.png)

   * The advantage of creating a branch is that <strong>parallel development</strong>
   can occur without risking the master branch.

   * Unlike Subversion, all files are available for change with a Git branch.

### Editing

Now we can edit the file named README.md. The md designates markdown format. 
Such a file GitHub creates with this specific name to describe each repository.

We can use vim or another text editor (such as nano, atom, etc.) to change contents inside files. 
Batch files would echo text to the bottom of the file.

### Status

The <strong>git status</strong> command details the status of changes to the repo. 

   * This command is used so often that many create an operating system level alias such as "gs".

### Add

You can change several files, but only the files you add to <strong>Git's staging area</strong> will be pushed to GitHub. 

The dot selects all files changed. The dash capital A parameter specifies that deleted files be processed. But many prefer to specifically add individual files to go into each particular commit, which works on all files added to staging. 

   * Alternately, "git add -u" adds all the files modified (not new files created and untracked).

   * Some prefer using the single dash to avoid needing to press the Shift key to get the double quote.

### Commit

The commit supplies a message describing changes, which applies to all files added. 

   * If you don't specify the dash m, Git will display a file containing comments as a prompt.
   Any line beginning with the # comment character will be ignored and not be part of the comment.

### Log

The <strong>git log</strong> command provides a history of all commits. It has lots of options, so to avoid typing all the parameters desired, most people define an alias of the command in git's config file.

   <tt>
git log --graph
   </tt>

   * Add <strong>-3</strong> to display only the last 3 commits.

   * If a colon appears at the bottom of the screen, press q to quit.

   * List a count of changes in each file in the commit (for example, abcdef1) with<br />
   <pre>git log --stat abcdef1</pre>. 


<strong>git reflog</strong> lists actions that have occurred on the local machine.

### Rebasing

Before pushing to GitHub, some prefer to rebase to squash some commits so that only one commit message appears for several commits made. 

   * Rebasing cleans up intermediate commits that is unwanted noise to the rest of the team.
   The extra commits complicates the history, and makes back-out of code more difficult.

   * Yes, this changes history, which is why we do it. But it's only on your local version.

### Push

The git push command sends to a remote what has been committed for a specific branch. 
If you didn't paste your public key into GitHub, you would get an error now.

### Push tags

When a commit is known good as the one to release, 
most organizations tag that specific commit with <a target="_blank" href="http://semver.org/">
semantic versioning</a> text.

   <pre>git tag v1.3.4</pre>

Tags require an additional git push command to be pushed to GitHub.

   <tt>git push --tags</tt>

### Delete branch

Because branches are just markers within Git, once a feature branch is in GitHub, 
that branch can be deleted from the local repo and from GitHub (by specifying that colon in front of the branch name). 

### Pull Request

Unless you have been designated a committer in the upstream repository, you can't push changes to it. But you can request their committers to pull changes from your forked repo. When a committer of that repo merges (or in other words, accepts) your PR, you'll get an email from GitHub.

### Upstream

Next, let's look at what happens if, over time, changes occur in the upstream repo. The git remote –verification command tells us that the origin remote was created, as usual, with the repo. To enable dowload by Git, we add the upstream remote. 

To obtain changes locally, many would rather NOT issue a git pull upstream command, which blindly fetches and automatically merges changes. Differences in the same line within the same file, Git is forced into automatic conflict resolution mode.

### fetch

So many prefer to take it one step at a time -- first a <pre>git fetch upstream</pre>, then a <pre>git checkout master</pre>. 


### gitk for diff

Now we can use a utility such as <strong>gitk</strong> to see what changes came in. 

   * Click the commit listed at the top, which is the most recent commit.

   * Alternately, there is also utilities vimdiff, meld, difftool, etc. 

   * To see the difference between what is in last commit vs. what's in the working folder:<br />
   <pre>git difftool</pre>

   * To see the difference between what is in last commit vs. what's added in the index cache:<br />
   <pre>git difftool --cached</pre>

   * You can make a default command such as this to explicitly specify some file to compare:<br />
   <pre>git diff HEAD HEAD^ -- <em>file1</em></pre><br />
   

### git merge

If they don't affect you, do a git merge. 

Notice the slash separator. Use a cat or less command to verify file contents. 


### git push origin master

Lastly, we git push to update origin master on our forked repository.

There are variations to these commands, but this is the typical workflow.

## git-flow software

Vincent's popular blog identified different types of updates at:<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model</a>

   * Hotfix from master and back to master
   * Bugfix
   * Release
   * Feature
   * Support

These branches are used more in corporate rather than open source software.

Atlassian presents their take on the different branches <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/gLWSJXBbJuE">

Instead of native git commands
the "git-flow" command is issued with a branch and whether you want to start (checkout) or finish:

   * <tt>git-flow hotfix finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git-flow bugfix finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git-flow release finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git-flow feature finish <em>branchx</em></tt>
   * <tt>git-flow support finish <em>branchx</em></tt>

### Hubflow fork software

Datasift people created an upgrade to GitFlow to work with GitHub, which they call 
<a target="_blank" href="https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/TheHubFlowTools.html">
   HubFlow</a>

   <pre>
git clone https://github.com/datasift/gitflow
cd gitflow
sudo ./install.sh
sudo git hf upgrade
   </pre>
