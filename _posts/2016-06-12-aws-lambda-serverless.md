The term "serverless" describes an <strong>architectural style</strong> 
where developers shift concerned about the hardware and its ability to scale to AWS Lambda.

Andrew Baird</a>, AWS Solutions Architect, 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2GQRC0sVA8&t=5m22s">
listed all the questions that developers DON'T have to graple with
in his March 2016 webinar "Getting Started with Serverless Architectures"</a>.

   "There are tools and entire industries whose entire value proposition are about answering just one of these."


The name "serverless" has been co-opted by enprepreneur

## Framework Structure #

The serverless framework save developers' time by standarizing the structure of folders and files.

   <pre>
s-project.json // Project file (JSON or YAML)
s-resources-cf.json  // CloudFormation template
s-templates.json // Config templates and variables
admin.env        // AWS Profiles (gitignored)
_meta            // Metadata (gitignored)
function1        // A function
  |__event.json
  |__handler.js
  |__s-function.json
   </pre>

The serverless framework provides the Node.js coding to read these files.

A key differentiator with the Serverless Framework is that infrastructure is defined as code in one project. 

Components are deployed per stage, allowing developers to easily deploy separate prod, test and dev environments.

Within the folder for each function is a <strong>s-function.json</strong> file containing metadata.

When the framework is created for a project, a .gitignore file is created with other files
to specify private and temporary work files that should not be publicly uploaded to GitHub.

The project metadata contains CloudFormation outputs and user variables. These are used in the function configurations. However, due to the sensitive nature of these variables, the metadata is gitignored by default.

The Serverless Meta Sync plugin can help with this by storing a projectâ€™s metadata in S3. 
However, this is not mentioned in the Serverless docs leaving many people confused.
