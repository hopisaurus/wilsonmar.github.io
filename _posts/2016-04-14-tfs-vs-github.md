## More than just version control

TFS is the community server behind Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE.

In 2010, TFS was primarily a replacement for Visual Source Safe product.

In 2012, TFS became a part of Microsoft's new
ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) "best practices":

   * Version Control
   * Requirements
   * Agile Planning - Plan and Track
   * Design
   * Develop
   * Automated Build
   * Testing & Defect Tracking
   * Feedback
   * Test Lab Management
   * Reporting

In 2015 TFS added more tools:

![tfs visual studio](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14761987/8a7ad558-092c-11e6-9107-4a19c089ecbd.png)

   * Layer Diagrams
   * Architecture Validation
   * UML diagrams

   * Code Analysis makes suggestions based on IL inspections

   * Unit Testing
   * Code Metrics (Cyclometric Complexity)
   * Code Coverage results appear in Build reports

   * During Manual Testing, capture video and IntelliTrace
   * Test Impact Analysis
   * "Coded UI" testing

   * Performance Testing (Lab Management)

## UML Diagrams:

   * Activity - flow of work between actions and participants
   * Component - Interfaces, prots, relationships
   * Class - types and relationships
   * Sequence - interactions between objects and components
   * Use case - goals and tasks

## New Build System with 2015

http://aka.ms/vsopreview
describes the TFBuild (Team Foundation Build)
yet also supports Java, Linux, and Apple XCode (XPlat),
on-prem or in the cloud
with Visual Studio Online.

https://github.com/Microsoft/vso-agent

TFBuild also supports previous XAML-based MSBuilds.

Several TFBuild servers can run at once in parallel.
Each server uses a pool of Agents that
can be used across several Collections.
Each collection has a queue.
An agent can belong to several queues.

## TFS setup

There is only one repository in each machine hosting TFS.
Git allows for many repos.

In TFS, create a <strong>team project</strong>,
then folders for each individual project and branches.

PROTIP: Naming conventions for team project name?

TFS 2012 had 3 process templates to define work item field names:

   * Visual Studio scrum 2.0
   * MSF for Agile Software Development 6.0
   * MSF for CMMI Process Improvement 6.0
   * SAFe for enterprises?

IN VS, a new project can be added to TFS with a checkbox, or added by right-clicking the Solution node.


## Git vs. TFS

TFS is a <strong>centralized</strong> version while<br />
Git is <strong>distributed</strong> as everyone has a full copy
of the whole repo and its history.

TFS has its own language:
Check-in/Check-out is a different concept.

TFS users "check-in" which invokes <strong>file locking</strong> whereas<br />
Git users do commits based on distributed full versions with difference checking.

TFS provides a "shelf" to hold local changes temporarily.<br />
Git provides a stash area away from items being committed.

Shelve-sets in TFS are stored in the centeral server.<br />
Stashed items in Git remain local machine.

TFS groups changes in sequentially numbered changesets.<br />
Git assigns a 32-byte hash to each commit.

TFS branches creates a new folder.

<a target="_blank" href="https://johanleino.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/tfs-vs-git-or-is-it-tfs-with-git/">
This site</a> summarizes the differences:

| TFVC | Git |
| Check-In | Commit + Push |
| Get Latest Version | Pull |
| ‘Map Local Path’ | Clone |
| Shelve | Stash (only local though) |
| Label | Tag |
| ‘Compare Local to Server’ | Fetch |
| Checkin and get Latest | Sync |


## Visual Studio GUI

To check-in right-click on the app within Team Explorer.
For VS 2013:

<img width="329" alt="vs2013 tfs app checkin" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14794922/659905da-0ae3-11e6-9d8b-9c074edd4379.png">

To see differences, right-click on the folder within Source Control Explorer.
For VS 2013:

![vs2013 sourcecontrolexplorer alt-click](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14795006/babfc7c4-0ae3-11e6-8ad2-004850d4fe91.png)

To apply a label, select Advanced:
For VS 2013:

To work on individual files, right-click on the file within Solution Explorer.
For VS 2013:
![vs2013 file alt-click sol explorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/14795366/6cf3bd32-0ae5-11e6-90d1-3d7768edc37e.png)


## Git is King?

Public repository websites at even Google and others
have moved to adopt Git and GitHub.

Visual Studio 2015 provides support for both GitHub and TFS.


## git-tfs bridge

As http://git-tfs.com/
describes, use Chocolately on a Windows machine:

   ```
   cinst GitTfs
   ```

The above is equivalent to:

   ```
   choco insttall Git-tf -y
   ```

Alternately, follow manual instructions at
https://gittf.codeplex.com/

This installs the contents of
https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs

Clone using the `git-tfs` command rather than `git` command:

   ```
   <strong>git-tfs</strong> clone http://github.com/etc.
   ```

## Remove TFC bindings

TFS source control bindings (*.vssscc files) are unique to TFS.
So remove it.
This can be done from within Visual Studio.

Edit your .sln file to remove the

   <pre>
   GlobalSection(TeamFoundationVersionControl) ...
   EndGlobalSection
   </pre>

## README.md Markdown File

One artifact unique to GitHub is the README.md file
(where .md means markdown or text).

It's optional but most GitHub repos have one.


## Keeping history

The issue is keeping history
