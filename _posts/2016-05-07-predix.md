Predix is GE's brand name for their "Industrial Internet" which incorporates Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence.

The technical components according to https://www.predix.io/resources/training

0. Eclipse IDE (text editor) with STS (Spring Tool Suite)
0. Java programming language
0. <a href="#Spring">Spring framework</a>
0. <a href="#OpenJPA">Apache OpenJPA persistence</a>
0. Maven build

## Eclipse IDE

<a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tool-suite-sts-eclipse">
Included with STS</a> is the developer edition of Pivotal tc Server, the drop-in replacement for Apache Tomcat thatâ€™s optimized for Spring.

The Spring Insight console, tc Server Developer Edition provides a graphical real-time view of application performance metrics that lets developers identify and diagnose problems from their desktops.

Eclipse v3.2 (2010) has annotation support used by OpenJPA 
defined in javax.persistence:

By default, all the fields are of type @Basic, which are persisted as-is in the database.

@Enitity signifies that a particular class is an entity class. If the entity name is different from the table name, then the @Table annotation is used; otherwise, it isn't required.

@Column provides the name of the column in a table if it is different from the attribute name. (By default, the two names are assumed to be the same.)

@Id signifies the primary key.

@Version signifies a version field in an entity. JPA uses a version field to detect concurrent modifications to a data store record. When the JPA runtime detects multiple attempts to concurrently modify the same record, it throws an exception to the transaction attempting to commit last. This prevents you from overwriting the previous commit with stale data.

@GeneratedValue signifies a strategy to assign a unique value to your identity fields automatically. The types of strategies available are IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, TABLE, and AUTO. The default strategy is auto, the implementation of which is left to the JPA vendor to implement. (OpenJPA implements it through a table sequence.)

## OpenJPA persistence

OpenJPA is a library to manage persistence and object/relational mapping (ORM) for Java EE and Java SE environments
to store data in a database.

https://dzone.com/articles/openjpa-introductory-tutorial
provides sample Geronimo site.

JPA supports SQL, but OpenJPA has a canonical query language named Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL).

https://github.com/apache/openjpa

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apache_OpenJPA
notes the source code is the basis for the core persistence engine of BEA Weblogic Server, IBM WebSphere, and the Apache Geronimo Application Server.

notes
The JPA specification was first introduced as part of JSR 220: EJB 3.0, with the goal of simplifying the EJB entity beans programming model. Although it all started with entity beans and is packaged with Java EE 5.0, JPA can be used outside the container in a Java SE environment.

Implements

Java Persistence 2.0
spec that went final in 2009.

QUESTION: Why is such advanced ML tech based on such old techology? Well, have you seen what's in Java 8? Spring Boot?

Three artifacts to implement a JPA-compliant program:

   0. An entity class
   0. A persistence.xml file
   0. A class through which you will insert, update, or find an entity.

http://www.jpab.org/OpenJPA.html
is not the fastest ORM/DB.
