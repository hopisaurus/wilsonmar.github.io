Here are my notes on re-thinking the placement of items in a small RV/van.

## Van make and model

0. The kind that allows someone to stand up straight:

   * Sprinter vans from Dodge Ram or Mercedes

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-buy-USPS-used-Ford-Windstar-postal-service-van-/10000000176074044/g.html">
   Nissan NV3500</a> HD Cargo vans are $28K for a V6 engine.

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freightlinersprinterusa.com/freightliner/"> 
   Frieghtliner</a> new are in the high $30-40K range.

   * Ford Transit Connect (made in Turkey)
    has a standard 169-hp 4-cylinder for 21 miles per gallon in the city and 29 mpg on the highway, 

   * Old Ford Winstar http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-buy-USPS-used-Ford-Windstar-postal-service-van-/10000000176074044/g.html

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.government-fleet.com/list/tag/usps.aspx">
   Used U.S. Postal Service Ram Promaster vans sold by GSA</a>
   are great if you don't intended on driving far.
   They were professionally maintained (oil changes on time, etc.)

   In 2015 USPS make a 9,000 commitment for Ram ProMaster 2500 vans.
   They are powered by a gasoline 3.6L Pentastar V-6 engine that produces 280 hp and 260 lb.-ft. of torque. (while other countries buy electric vehicles)
   The USPS plans to hold on to this newer fleet of vehicles for at least the next twenty years.

   Left hand drive only

   -Back up monitor too easy to knock off the window. On my third one already

   -Height of driver seat is not adjustable

   ### Sprinter vans

   These are rear-wheel drive.
   Not so good for the snow.

## High profile for stand-up desk

This is a must-have for me, and the whole reason for getting a van in which I can stand up.

STRATEGY: Since I won't be sleep while I use the stand-up desk, put the desk above the bed.
But this means I have to always clean up my desk before going to sleep.

So is it worth the risk of tip-over when blown by a fast wind?

Alternately, have a pop-up installed.
This would be only for summer use, though.


## Several 12V Batteries

Yeah, I need them to power my laptop.
   
   ### Solar panel

## Bed

Thick memory foam on a board.

QUESTION: The board can be quite heavy.

Folded against the wall to get it out of the way.

But won't I be outside?

## Closet

Needed for hanging up coats and suits.
Near the entrance.
Does not need to be kept warm/cool.

Additional storage for clothing. A separate bin for soiled clothing.

## Fridge

http://www.norcold.com/norcold/index.html

Refrigerators built to withstand the vibrations going down the road
automatically switch to run off LP Gas when there is no electricity.
Some have a 3-way option to run off AC Power, DC Power, or LP Gas.

RV friges go from $1,100 to over $3000 for larger units.
Contact RV dealers for closeouts and refurbished units.

PROTIP: I got a free-standing one for its flexibility anywhere, including outside.

STRATEGY: In Winters, wheel the fridge in to the cockpit area (passenger seat area)
which isn't kept heated at night in the Winter.
This would save

Is an <strong>ice maker</strong> a deal-breaker or a non-essential for you?
I prefer more spece to the freezer unit, so I use the room for frozen foods,
and make ice rather than keep liquids cold.

A fridge helps to keep diary, fruits, and vegetables cold.
Some need one to keep their medicines cold.

4.3-cubic feet, 

Use a level when installing to keep the unit level.

Adding a battery-operated RV refrigerator fan will not only decrease your cool down time by 50%, but it will also help temperatures remain more consistent.  These little gems run on two “D cell”  batteries for 30 days or more. They are a great long- term, money-saving option, with only $15 for the initial investment.

## Freezer

Ah. Cold ice cream on a hot day.


## Microwave

This is a must-have for many at home.

But consider that it's expensive to keep food frozen.

So maybe a hotpot is all you need with freeze-dried food that requires no refrigeration.


## Hot kettle

Boils water

This would need to be put away when the van is moving.


## Sink and Gray Water collector


## Laundry


## Cook-stove

A cook top is not necessary if you're a summer BBQ kind of people.


## Hot Shower

This is a luxury item for trips -- the key differentiator why one would get a van
rather than sleeping in a car.

STRATEGY: Put the shower next to the door, so it can dry out by opening the door.
This also makes sense because it's an easy way to wash out what is the dirtest part of the floor.
The shower curtain around the door makes for a "mud room" which keeps out drafts into the van. Brilliant.

STRATEGY: Put the shower next to the oven.

STRATEGY: Put the hot air vent so it blows into the shower area.

STRATEGY: Vent steamy air directly to outside, not into the living space to cause mildew.


## Toilet

STRATEGY: Place the toilet near the bed for quicker access.

Chemical toilets like the onese on airplanes smell.

Composting toilet

Or if you're at a place where there are bathrooms, 
wide-mouth bottles plus
a simple single-use toilet could be enough.

Water in toilet area, when hosed down, flow outside.
