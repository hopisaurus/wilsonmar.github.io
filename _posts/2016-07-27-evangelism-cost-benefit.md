There are more ideas than money to do them.

The best evangelists focus on getting the maximum benefit from the least time, money, and risk.

[TODO: diagram here ]

The diagram above presents a scatterchart of two axes:

   * On the vertical scale, relative <strong>benefit</strong>

   * On the horizonal scale, relative <strong>cost</strong> 

No hard money numbers are used because the amount can vary depending on your specific situation.

There are many ways to measure benefit:

   * Press and social media mentions
   * Number who applied for a job
   * New prospects expressing interest
   * New customers who purchased

There are several aspects to cost:

   * Time to talk about it
   * Time to do it
   * Supplies
   * Potential for damage to reputation, etc.
