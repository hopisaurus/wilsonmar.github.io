This article examines instructions to developers from
Predix, GE's brand name for their "Industrial Internet" which 
incorporates Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.

advises the use of STS 


0. Use an interest browser to the STS website.
0. Select a download site to begin download. Wait for the file to download.
0. Unzip
0. In Finder, navigate inside the folder, such as:

   ~/Documents/workspace-sts-3.8.0.RELEASE

   This contains the server.

0. Move and/or rename the folder according to your organization's standards.

0. In Finder navigate to /Applications.
0. Move (drag and drop) STS.app to /Applications.
0. Open STS by double-clicking the icon.
0. Click Open icon for first-time confirmation.
0. Specify your workspace.



## STS (Spring Tools Suite) #

<a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tool-suite-sts-eclipse">
Included with STS</a> (Spring Tools Suite)
is the developer edition of Pivotal tc Server, 
the drop-in replacement for Apache Tomcat thatâ€™s optimized for Spring.

The Spring Insight console, tc Server Developer Edition, 
provides a graphical real-time view of application performance metrics that lets developers identify and diagnose problems from their desktops.


<a name="Spring"></a>

## Spring framework

The framework is based on the Java Spring framework,
which many now consider "heavy".

This is surprising considering most others in their industry
have gone to Python or React.

QUESTION: Why Spring and not Node or Python or React?

Maybe it's because there are more Java Spring developers unemployed than the other hotter frameworks?

Or that Spring is more "mature" as a framework since it's been around since the 90's.

## <a name="OpenJPA">OpenJPA persistence</a> #


Eclipse v3.2 (2010) has annotation support used by OpenJPA.
defined in javax.persistence:
 which is left to the JPA vendor to implement. (OpenJPA implements it through a table sequence.)

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apache/openjpa">
OpenJPA</a> is a library to manage persistence and 
object/relational mapping (ORM) for Java EE and Java SE environments
to store data in a database.

It implements the <a target="_blank" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317">
Java Persistence 2.0 spec at https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317</a>
 that went final in 2009.

Three artifacts to implement a JPA-compliant program:

   0. An entity class
   0. A persistence.xml file
   0. A class through which you will insert, update, or find an entity.

QUESTION: XML? In 2016.  Really?

JPA supports SQL, but OpenJPA has a canonical query language 
named Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL).

Some rants about JPA:

   * http://openjpa.apache.org/quick-start.html

   * http://www.jpab.org/OpenJPA.html
   is not the fastest ORM/DB.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apache_OpenJPA">
The Wikipedia article on it</a>
notes the source code is the basis for the core persistence engine of BEA Weblogic Server, IBM WebSphere, and the Apache Geronimo Application Server.

notes
The JPA specification was first introduced as part of JSR 220: EJB 3.0, 
with the goal of "simplifying" the EJB entity beans programming model. 
Although it all started with entity beans and is packaged with Java EE 5.0, 
JPA can be used outside the container in a Java SE environment.

QUESTION: Why is such advanced ML tech based on such old techology? 
Well, have you seen what's in Java 8? Spring Boot?

### JPA Fields #


By default, all the fields are of type @Basic, which are persisted as-is in the database.

@Enitity signifies that a particular class is an entity class. If the entity name is different from the table name, then the @Table annotation is used; otherwise, it isn't required.

@Column provides the name of the column in a table if it is different from the attribute name. (By default, the two names are assumed to be the same.)

@Id signifies the primary key.

@Version signifies a version field in an entity. JPA uses a version field to detect concurrent modifications to a data store record. When the JPA runtime detects multiple attempts to concurrently modify the same record, it throws an exception to the transaction attempting to commit last. This prevents you from overwriting the previous commit with stale data.

@GeneratedValue signifies a strategy to assign a unique value to your identity fields automatically. The types of strategies available are IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, TABLE, and AUTO. The default strategy is auto
