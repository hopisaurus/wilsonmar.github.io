Here are the sequence of specific steps to build a website -
a <a target="_blank" href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM stack</a> 
-- the "ideal" way of building websites and apps that are fast, secure, and simple to work with. 
JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup - the components of software
leveraging the latest advances in computer science.
Content for the site is written in markup language stored on GitHub.com.

JavaScript on the site makes calls to API (Application Programming Interfaces) web services in the cloud
to manage subscription forms and email campaigns.
