This article shows you how to install and configure 
GitHub hooks into Jenkins version 2 for Continuous Delivery (CD) as well as Continuouse Integration (CI).

{% include _intro.html %}

## Receivers first #

We would like Jenkins to attempt a new build when a change is committed in GitHub.com or pushed to it from Git.

   The alternative to this is polling on a scheduled interval,
   which can be a little bit inefficient if nothing was changed.
   However, a regular schedule is useful when people work strict hours.

   ### Begin from Jenkins #

0. In Manage Jenkins | Manage Plugins, Available tab, find "GitHub plugin" at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin/">
   https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin</a>
0. Return to the Jenkins Dashboard.
0. Create a new item or click an existing build job.
0. Select Configure from the menu.
0. In v2, under Build Triggers, Check "GitHub project".
   
   In v1, scroll to "Source Code Management". Check "Git".

0. Specify the Project URL.
0. Check "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub".


   ## Set up CRSF on Jenkins #

   Cross Site Request Forgery (CRSF) exploits
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">
   Cross-origin_resource_sharing</a>, so all PUTs are excluded, except when
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/commit/5c2a041">
   an exception is added in Jenkins</a>.
  
0. Type in the Filter field <strong>CORS support for Jenkins</strong> until the plugin appears
   on the Manage Jenkins, Plugin Manager, Available page.

0. If it appears, check the box under "Installed" .

   If it doesn't appear, click on the Installed tab to see if it's there already.

0. If you click on the link, the name is "Cors Filter Plugin" on<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CSRF+Protection">
   https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CSRF+Protection</a>

0. "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits"
   needs to be unchecked 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20140/">
   disabled</a>
   in order for webhooks to work.

0. In the authentication section, near the bottom,<br />
   check the box "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits".
   
0. Click "Install without restart" of the Jenkins server.

   The response is temporarily until "Success" appears.

   <pre>
Checking internet connectivity
Checking update center connectivity
Success
   </pre>

0. Click "Restart Jenkins when no jobs are running".



## Get GitHub secret #

The below describes the use of a "deploy key" where a public-private SSH key pair is generated for each 
GitHub SCM repository. Each key pair is attached to a repository instead of to a personal user account.
The public key is stored on the Jenkins server.
The correpsonding public key is stored in the repository along with the code.
Jenkins matches the public and public keys before granting access to each single GitHub repository.

See https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/

0. In a Terminal command-line on your <strong>Jenkins server</a>, 
   generate a keypair:

   <tt><strong>
   ssh-keygen -C "server123@xyz.com"
   </strong></tt>

   PROTIP: Some enterprises have a central list of servers with unique names.

   NOTE: Some alternatives to Jenkins provide a UI to generate keys.

0. Specify file names. The default is "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub" containing the public key.

0. Specify a passphrase.

0. Copy the public and private key files to your local laptop.

   Alternately, get the public key into your invisible Clipboard:
   Open the public key file and hightlight all the works, then press Command+C.

0. Switch to GitHub.com.

0. In the top right corner of any GitHub page, click your profile photo.

0. On your profile page, click the Repositories tab.

0. Click the name of your repository.

0. Click Settings in your repository's right sidebar.

0. Click Deploy Keys In the sidebar.

0. Click Add deploy key. 

0. Paste your public key in and click Submit.


## Set up webhook on GitHub #

0. Sign into the repository. You won't see the "Settings" tab unless you have permissions.
0. Click on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.
0. Click on "Webhooks & services" from the left menu.
0. Click on "Add webhook" on the upper right.

   Webhooks allow external services to be notified when certain events happen within your repository. When the specified events happen, weâ€™ll send a POST request to each of the URLs you provide. 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/">
   https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating</a><br />
   explains each field:

0. In Payload URL goes a URL such as "http://localhost:4567/payload" or

   <tt><strong>
   http://138.68.1.138:8080/github-webhook/
   </strong></tt>

   CAUTION: Use http://

0. For Content type, "application/json" sends a HTTP POST. 
   Older form data is sent with "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

0. For secret, leave blank ???

0. Select "Just the push event" for "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?"
   or too much will be sent.

   The technical name of all events are described at<br />
   https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events

0. Click Add Webhook.

   GitHub sends a Ping<br />
   https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#ping-event.



   ### Test if it works #

   There are several ways to check: 

   * changes on GitHub.com by those with permissions
   * changes pushed to GitHub from a Git client
   * changes in a Pull Request accepted.

   Do each of the above when the Jenkins server is down,
   then start it up again to see if queuing worked.

   ### Pull Request #

0. On GitHub, at your repo, fork the repo to your account.

0. On your local machine, create a folder and clone from your account's copy of the repo.

0. Checkout the current commit to a new branch.

0. Make a change in the README.md file.

0. Git add and commit.

0. Git Push it back to GitHub.

0. Accept the PR. Note the time, and if the Jenkins server is on another time zone (UTC),
   translate the time on the Jenkins server.

0. On the Jenkins jobs Dashboard, select the project you updated to see a new job invoked.

0. See the new job from "anonymous user"?

TODO: Quote URL which says "Payload sizes need to be monitored because GitHub caps them at 5 MB each."


The objective of Jenkins2 is to install with a 
<a href="#RecommendedPlugins">recommended set of plugins</a>
(a more "curated" experience than v1)
that cover 80% of use cases out of the box.
