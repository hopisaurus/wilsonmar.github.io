## Sample C# Code

### Nerd Diner Sample App

<a target="_blank" href="http://nerddinner.com/">
http://nerddinner.com</a> 
presents a sample .NET MVC app.

The app enables registered users to create, edit, and delete dinners.

The app was written in 2009
by Scott Hanselman, Scott Guthrie, and others at Microsoft.

The app was built to be run locally because its source code is available at<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/">
http://nerddinner.codeplex.com</a>
(http://tinyurl.com/aspnetmvc).
The website describes new features added on August 2011 along with updates for ASP.NET MVC 3.

PROTIP: Use Git to clone the more recent (2016) MVC 5 version on GitHub:
