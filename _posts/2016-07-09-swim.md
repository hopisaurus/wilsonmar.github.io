{% include _toc.html %}

This tutorial aims to enable someone with minimal tech experience to critically evaluate the internals of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.swim.it/">swim.it</a> 
cloud service using its sample code.

We try to make sense of confusing marketing hype and technical buzzwords 
by explaining them in context as we take it step-by-step,
with NOTEs and PROTIPs along the way.

We try to minimize the "mental gymastics" one has to do to understand a system
by carefully sequencing the commentary below.

We'll explain these buzzwords in context:

   * real-time 
   * bidirectional
   * low latency 
   * Streams
   * stateful
   * Asynch REST API
   * push network
   * persistent links subscription
   * multiplexes
   * Reactive
   * IoT
   * Global Actor Model
   * Peer-to-Peer messaging
   * SDK
   * iOS 
   * Androic
   * Scala

   https://github.com/swimit/swim-examples/wiki</a>

   Sure, "anyone" can code this library (in a 24 hour hackathon), 
   but this team has done it
   but putting together all the other many aspects of a software development organization.
   See my list of [what a Developer Evangelist needes to consider](/evangelist/).

## Browser sample chat in the cloud #

Let's look at how the company's sample app works to see how it interacts with their SWIM cloud.

0. Use an internet browser (such as Google Chrome) to

   <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/#/chat/public">
   http://chat.swim.it/#/chat/public</a>

   <amp-img width="324" height="103" alt="swim chat client screen 324x103-c67.jpg"
   layout="responsive" 
   src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/16707566/7fbdf866-4590-11e6-800b-371d8d3cb18c.jpg">
   </amp-img><br /><br />

   This communicates with a SWIM service running within the AWS EC2 public cloud infrastructure.

0. Click <strong>Sign In</strong> at the lower left.
0. Select your Google account in the pop-up window that appears.

   We're assuming that you have a Google account.

0. Click Allow.

   </amp-img><br /><br />

0. Click on a topic <strong>channel</strong> at the left, such as "Public".

0. Type a message such as "hello".

   Because this app is intended for use as a demo for developers,
   it has a UI feature that is usually not in production apps.

   NEXT: We'll be examining each of the client code fragments exposed by the sample app
   as we build our own client app running locally.

0. Click on the "{}" above the Send button at the lower-right on the UI, 
   to expose code for Streaming chat messages:

   <pre>
Client:
&nbsp;
var chat = swim.downlink()
  <a href="#websockets">.node('ws://messenger.swim.services/chat/public')</a>
  <a href="#ServiceChat">.lane('chat/room')</a>
  .onEvent(function (message) {
    // redraw UI with elements of chat.state array
  })
  .keepAlive(true) // reconnect after network failure
  .syncList(); // keep state synchronized
&nbsp;
Server:
&nbsp;
var chatRoom = new service.ListLane().register('chat/room');
   </pre>

   NEXT: We'll look at this code after we build the client code and its development environment.

## Chat client libraries #

0. Alt-click on the demo chat client page to View source.

   All of them are (rightly) minified of white space and line breaks for smaller and thus quicker usage.

   In addition to the libraries unique to the app:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/styles/app.min.css">styles/app.min.css</a> from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css">github.com/necolas/normalize.css</a> for a modern alternative to CSS resets that
   1) correct the line height in all browsers and 2) prevent adjustments of font size after orientation changes in IE and iOS.

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/scripts/app.min.js">scripts/app.min.js</a>
   <br /><br />

   The libraries used by this app are:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/scripts/modernizr.js">modernizr.js</a> (by Paul Irish)

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/scripts/jquery/jquery.min.js">jquery.min.js</a> v2.2.1 from http://jquery.com/ - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery/ or https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js">https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js</a> for Google Sign-in - see https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

   Angular v1 from http://angularjs.org:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/scripts/angular/angular.min.js">scripts/angular/angular.min.js</a>  v1.4.9
   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/scripts/angular/angular-ui-router.min.js">scripts/angular/angular-ui-router.min.js</a> v0.2.18
   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/scripts/angular/angular-animate.min.js">scripts/angular/angular-animate.min.js</a> v1.4.9 
 
   * <a target="_blank" href="http://chat.swim.it/scripts/foundation/foundation-apps.min.js">foundation-apps.min.js</a> - Angular-powered framework from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps">https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps</a>
   (CDN versions at https://cdnjs.com/libraries/foundation)


## Build locally #

   NEXT: To get a better understanding of the client app, let's construct it on a local machine.

0. On a Mac, a pre-requisite is to [install Homebrew](/macos-homebrew/).

   See http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/homebrew-demystified-os-xs-ultimate-package-manager--mac-44884

0. Extract the swim project from the swimit organization on GitHub:

   As described in https://github.com/swimit/swimjs

   <tt><strong>
   brew tap <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swimit/swim/tree/master/repo">swimit/swim</a><br />
   brew install swimjs
   </strong></tt>

   BLAH: "swimit" nor "swimjs" are found in http://brewformulas.org/ nor
   http://braumeister.org/
   This is fine because logic for the sample client app should be 
   built alongside the server app to ensure version integrity.


   This command makes use of the ruby file at
   https://github.com/swimit/homebrew-swim/blob/master/swimjs.rb

   {% highlight text %}
class Swimjs < Formula
  desc "Swim JavaScript Runtime"
  homepage "http://www.swim.it"
  url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swimit/swim/master/repo/swimjs-0.1.0-alpha3.tar.gz"
  version "0.1.0-alpha3"
  sha256 "d77880795f3ab904add10de351cefe6b45fc225a5754ef29c6ce75b7892105e0"

  depends_on :java => "1.8+"

  def install
    rm_f Dir["bin/*.bat"]
    libexec.install "bin", "lib"
    bin.install_symlink Dir["#{libexec}/bin/*"]
  end
end
}{% endhighlight %}



0. Examine:

   Angular
   Bootstrap

https://github.com/swimit/swimjs/blob/master/examples/chat-presence/chat.js



0. Install the Swim client using the Node.js Package Manager:

   As described in https://github.com/swimit/swim-client-js

   <tt><strong>
   npm install --save swim-client-js
   </strong></tt>




   "ListLane" is unique to SWIM.

   "keepAlive" is another distinctive of SWIM. The connection is kept alive.

Synchronizing chat channels:

   <pre>
Client
var channels = swim.downlink()
  .node('')
  .lane('group/chats')
  .primaryKey(function (channel) { return channel.chatUri; })
  .onEvent(function (message) {
    // redraw UI with elements of channels.state array
  })
  .sortBy('name') // sort alphabetically by channel name
  .keepAlive(true) // reconnect after network failure
  .syncMap(); // keep state synchronized
Server
var groupChats = new service.MapLane().register('group/chats'); // map from chat URIs to channel info
var chatInfo = new service.JoinLane().register('chat/info'); // aggregate chat/info streams
chatInfo.onJoinEvent = function (message, downlink) {
  // called when channel info updates
  var groupChat = groupChats.get(downlink.nodeUri) || {};
  recon.set(groupChat, 'userCount', message.body.userCount); // update present user count
  groupChats.set(downlink.nodeUri, groupChat);
};
chatInfo.onJoinLinked = function (response, downlink) {
  // called when channel added to group
};
chatInfo.onJoinClose = function (downlink) {
  // called when channel removed from group
  groupChats.delete(downlink.nodeUri);
};
   </pre>

### recon JSON #

In the course of construction, SWIM developers 
created a library that has general applicability for other projects.

   require('recon-js');
   https://www.npmjs.com/package/recon-js
   Record Notation (RECON)
   RECON brings attributes into the era of object notation, and provides a simple grammar and uniform tree model for attributed text markup. RECON aims to combine the minimalism of JSON with the expressiveness of XML in a human-friendly syntax.
   https://github.com/swimit/recon-js


https://github.com/swimit/swimjs/blob/master/examples/chat-presence/swim.recon

   <pre>
@server {
  port: 5619
  store: "chat.store"
  auth: test
&nbsp;
  @route {
    prefix: "/chat/"
    service: "chat"
  }
}
&nbsp;
@service {
  name: "chat"
  main: "chat.js"
}
   </pre>

@event, @server, @service, are <strong>datatypes</strong>
described for humans in
???

@ack, @auth, @deauth, @event, @link, @unlink, @sync, @command, etc.
are <strong>datatypes</strong>
described for humans in
