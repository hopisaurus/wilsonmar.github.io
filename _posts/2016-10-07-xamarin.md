{% include _toc.html %}

This article is a hands-on deep-dive tutorial about installing and using
Microsoft's Xamarin app development IDE and framework to create 
iOS and Android apps using the C# language.

TODO: My objective is to build a "Hello World" sample app code that 
compiles and builds from a single command,
while I learn to be a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6664619/profile">
Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer</a>.
Right now (January 2017), none of the samples "Just Work".

## Competitors

Xamarin's main competitor in the multi-platform development tools market
is Facebook's React Native.


## Run-times on mobile #

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono-project</a> 
is the run-time engine equivalent to 
Microsoft's .NET Core on other platforms. 
It implements .NET APIs and plays with .NET Standard so you donâ€™t have to worry about the implmentation under the hood.
In fact, there is a single .NET super optmized runtime that brings 
.NET to iOS, Android, macOS, Apple tvOS, IoT, Linux, PS4, Xbox, etc. 

   Some marketing materials say "15%-30%" of all code is shared among platforms.
   But you'll need to see for yourself.

Examples of device platform-specific code include access to:

   * system information (such as battery life)
   * personal information (such as device name)
   * folders and files on the device
   * external devices (such as Bluetooth)
   * notifications
   <br /><br />


   PROTIP: Jumping into a platform is a rather big career decision.
   Few people have time to be expert in tools for several languages.
   The fragmentation in Java and Android tools makes it difficult to be quickly productive when moving jobs
   since there are so many variations of tools to master.
   Even though Microsoft does limit and change (abandon) technologies over time,
   their ecosystem offers more focused training resources and help for learners make it easier to master
   and provides better movement among employers. My two cents.


On April, 2016, 
Microsoft open sourced Xamarin at
http://open.xamarin.com/

   * https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios
   * https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android
   * https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms<br />
   https://www.xamarin.com/forms

## Pre-built apps in Azure cloud

CAUTION: This section under construction:

   PROTIP: Instead of clicking to download one or more of the Forms apps,
   first install the app without building from source code from 
   https://github.com/xamarin/app-crm/wiki/Install-the-app-NOW-without-building-from-source-code

Even before software is installed locally,
experience a pre-built app running live on Microsoft's cloud at:

## Pricing of solution components #

The home page for Xamarin is <a target="_blank" href="https://xamarin.com/">
   xamarin.com</a>. Click on <strong>Products</strong>.

   ![xamarin ecosystem 20161025](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/19684717/0c2e3880-9a76-11e6-9e3a-744d0218d5e1.png)

   Let's review the components by looking at pricing as well while 
   we install the software.

   PROTIP: It costs <strong>$11,759.50</strong> per person
   to use the entire ecosystem the first year.

   * $5,999 for Visual Studio Enterprise

## Buy MSDN license

0. To buy the MSDN subscription with an email you'll be using to build software:

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/">
   https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing</a> says 
   Visual Studio Enterprise is<br />
   <strong>$5,999</strong> for the first year and then each additional year<br />
   $2,569. However, some Microsoft Partners sell it for less.

   However, Mac users now still need an <strong>Enterprise Visual Studio</strong> 
   license.

0. Use the email you used to get your license to login MSDN.com,
   Subscriptions at:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900">
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900</a>.

0. Scroll down to <strong>Xamarin Studio (for OSX)</strong> and 
   click "Register and Download".

   NOTE: Xamarin was an independent organization (in San Francisco) 
   which charged <strong>$5,697 per user per year per platform</strong>

   * Xamarin.Android Visual Studio Enterprise 
   * Xamarin.iOS Visual Studio Enterprise
   * Xamarin.Mac Visual Studio Enterprise
   <br /><br />

   See https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/license/

0. To create a Xamarin account if you don't already have one,<br />
   click Subscribe.

   Microsoft bought Xamarin in Feb. 2016
   and (at Build 2016), so there is still a separate system.

   PROTIP: Notice it's an annual renewal.

   PROTIP: Work on Xamarin Studio has stopped on Windows.
   Microsoft is working on a Visual Studio for Mac.


## Install Xamarin Platform IDEs #

   "Platform" here refers to the tools to develop software.

   An Apple Mac machine is needed only to compile code to run on Apple iOS devices.
   One can NOT be shared. 
   So the MacInCloud service connects each Windows machine with a separate Mac.


   NOTE: Xamarin Studio is no longer available on Windows.

   <strong>Parallels</strong> software, not being true virtualization, 
   is an advantage is this case.
   On a Mac, one can install <strong>Parallels</strong> software,
   then install Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 for Windows inside that,
   and you'll be able to run Windows Phone emulators as well.
   
   PROTIP: Windows Phone is dead anyway in 2016.
   So this approach is not recommended.

0. If you're behind a corporate firewall proxy, talk to your security officer about
   <strong>whitelisting</strong> these hosts:

   * dl-ssl.google.com
   * dl.google.com
   * xamarin.com
   * download.xamarin.com
   * dl.xamarin.com
   * log.xamarin.com
   <br /><br />

   This tip is from 
   https://blog.xamarin.com/installing-xamarin-made-easy-offline-installation/

0. Install Apple's <strong>XCode</strong> on your Mac's App Store.

   NOTE: Each version is related to a specific version of the Apple OS Mac operating system.

   Know the version by clicking on the program name next to the Apple icon, 
   then select "About":

   ![xcode about 271x48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/21987451/dc44154a-dbc0-11e6-90b6-4dce91b8c5d2.png)

   At the time of writing, my pop-up shows "Version 8.1 (8B62)".

   https://github.com/xamarin/Homebrew-Formulas
   provides a Tap for Xamarin-specific Homebrew formulas

### Visual Studio on Mac #

   PROTIP: Although Xamarin Studio is currently offered,
   its functonality is being folded into 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">
   Visual Studio 2017 for Mac</a>, free in Preview until May 31, 2017.

   I predict in the future this will become a paid Visual Studio Enterprise for Mac.

0. Click to download <strong>VisualStudioforMacPreviewInstaller.dmg</strong>,
   22.8 MB.

0. Skip to follow <a href="#MacInstall">these same instructions</a>.



### Xamarin Studio on Mac #


0. Click on the "Download Now" on this page.

0. During VS installation, under 
   <strong>Cross Platform Mobile Development</strong>,
   choose <strong>Custom</strong> and
   select feature <strong>C#/.NET (Xamarin) [3rd Party]</strong>.

   <!-- If you already have VS installed, go to the Control Panel 
   and change the features. -->

0. PROTIP: Before you begin, make sure you have enough disk space.
   The whole install will be shown as near 3 GB (2.2 GB they say).

0. PROTIP: Since different versions of installers have the same name,
   XamarinInstaller.dmg, change the name downloaded with a date such as
   
   <pre>XamarinInstaller_2016.10.24.dmg</pre> takes 22.2 MB according to my Finder.

0. Double-click on it in your Downloads folder to expand.

   <a name="MacInstall"></a>

   ### Mac instructions #

0. Double-click the big down-arrow orange icon to open another window.
   If you don't see the new window press command+tab and tab to the orange icon.

0. Check the checkbox and click Accept.

0. Click on Dependencies and unselect the <strong>components</strong> you don't want, then
   click Continue.

   ![xamarin 6 1 1 install 525x176](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/21961331/5925261a-dac4-11e6-97f7-3a17216bdeb7.png)

   Notice the disk space usage (242 MB) and path (with "mac" subsituted for your account name):

   <tt><strong>
   /Users/mac/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx
   </strong></tt>

0. Click Continue.
0. Click Install.
0. Check "I agree" to the Licenses, then Continue.

   PROTIP: You'll be prompted several times to enter your Mac user's password.
   So don't walk off.

0. Visit the <a href="#WhileWaiting">While Waiting</a> section, then return here.

0. When "Installation successful" appears, 
   click "Quit" or "Start" to invoke Visual Studio Community app.

   <img alt="xamarin icon 412x386" width="100" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/21965941/f8fd7e46-db26-11e6-8c7f-560aeb1bdcb1.png">

0. When Xamarin Studio opens (as "community"), click Login.
0. After Login, "Enterprise" should appear at the upper left corner.




### Visual Studio on Windows #

   Those developing on Windows machines work on iPhone by
   running a remote session on a Mac through a cable and running SSH.

   NOTE: Since mobile devices will need to use virtualization,
   the IDE can't also be running in a virtualized environment such as
   VMWare Fusion.

   NOTE: Installation includes 
   Xamarin Mac Agent (previously called the Xamarin Build Host).
   Its use includes enabling Remote Login on the Mac
   on the same Network subnet with the Mac's IP address.


   There is a free "Community" edition of Visual Studio on Windows.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/compare-visual-studio/">
   But the Community edition doesn't include support</a>.

0. Go to<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/download/">
   https://www.xamarin.com/download</a>.

0. Create an account or SignIn.

   PROTIP: Many open several accounts for this to get around 
   Microsoft's 30-day trial limits plus 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://store.xamarin.com/account/my/subscription/redeemextension">
   redeeming</a> a 30 day extension approval.

   Your picture appears from your email based on 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gravatar.com/">
   Gravatar.com</a>.

0. Select Product and Xamarin Platform.
   Click "Download now for free".

   It recognizes what operating system you're using 
   based on what browser you used to visit the site.

0. Fill out the form to begin downloading.

0. Obtain a VS 2015 Community Edition web
   installer from https://visualstudio.com.

0. Run the downloader and it downloads the rest.

0. From your Installer folder, invoke the downloaded file.

   Visit the <a href="#WhileWaiting">While waiting</a> section
   if you are not installing on a Mac.



<a name="WhileWaiting"></a>

### While waiting

0. While you wait for the download, return to the "Xamarin Installer" pop-up screen,

## Homebrew Mono #

<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=xamarin">
In StackOverflow</a> 
are several complaints about brew issues.

0. Rather than manually download the installer from 
   https://xamarin.com,
   installing mono-mdk instead of mono from homebrew.

   ```
   brew cask install mono-mdk
   ```

You can also modify your PATH to use mono-mdk's binary:

export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:$PATH 

https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/

-->

### Clean up disk

0. PROTIP: In Finder, alt-click the XamarinInstaller .dmg file
   to move it to Trash. In the left menu eject the "Xamarin Installer".
   Also clean out your Trash can to recover disk space.

0. PROTIP: If you're going to be using it a lot:
   draw 3 fingers together on the touchpad. Click "X" for Xamarin.

   You'll see "Xamarin Studio", Xamarin Profile, and Xamarin Workbooks.

0. Drag and drop the Xamarin Studio icon to the bar at the bottom of the screen.

The above only needs to be done once per machine.

<a name="IDEIntro"></a>

## IDE intro with sample app #

0. When Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio is opened and Logged in,
   it presents its <strong>Welcome page</strong>.

0. PROTIP: Return to the Welcome page anytime from the Windows menu.

   The IDE has 3 vertical panes. One pane displays links to news items.
   Another pane has links to tutorials such as
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/">
   Learn about Mobile Development with Xamarin</a>.

   PROTIP: Let's begin by looking at Solution is.


   ### New solution templates

0. Click on File | New Solution or press Shift+command+N,
   which presents the various types of solution templates.

   ![vs2017 template 400x172](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/22003489/41ec9782-dc11-11e6-9f83-959cedb7f9ef.png)

   The default is a Multiplatform Xamarin.Forms Forms app.

   All coding is in C# or F#. No VB, C++, etc.

   "Connected" apps are also called "ASP.NET Core" mobile services apps.

   Multiplatform games are created with either SpriteKit or SceneKit.

0. Click the left pane's iOS App to see that Metal and OpenGL game templates are selected there.

   For iOS under the General category are templates specific to iOS, such as
   Single View, etc.

0. Click the left pane's Android App to see templates for Android,
   such as Wear and WebView (hybrid) apps.

0. Scroll down the bottom of the left pane to see the "Other" solutions 
   traditionally supported by Visual Studio:
   .NET and ASP.NET.

   PROTIP: Now let's look at some pre-built apps.

0. Press Esc key to dismiss the dialog.

   Let's now get an understanding of coding by looking at the 
   <a href="PreBuilts">pre-built apps downloaded</a>.
   for Forms apps.


   ### Development approaches

   PROTIP: The types of development approaches:

   * Silo approach of writing Objective-C code for iOS and Java code for Android provided by vendors.
   This requires different developer teams.

   * Black Box takes a single (HTML/JavaScript) code base to create multiple apps with 
   "minimum common" features common across the platforms.

   * Xamarin Forms 

   Xamarin Forms is simpler to program, but you might run into a "brick wall"
   when you need to re-code using the native coding approach.
   But if you can live with eventual limitations,
   Forms is a quick way to get to an app quickly.


   ### XWeather sample app

0. In Finder, navigate into a folder containing app source.

   PROTIP: Open Visual Studio by clicking on a <strong>.sln</strong> (solution) file
   in a folder containing its other files.

0. In Finder, navigate into the XWeather sample app to where the
   <strong>XWeather.sln</strong> (solution) file is listed.

0. Open Visual Studio by clicking on the .sln file.


   ### Structure of folders and files

   After an analysis of various examples, XWeather has what I think the most comprehensible structure for
   folders and files. Here's the tree from root of the app folder:

   * .gitignore
   * images/____.png for the app's sample UI image for display in the store
   * README.md
   * LICENSE.md
   * XWeather folder

   Within the XWeather (alphabetically):
   Code for .Droid and .iOS are generated automatically.

   * Droid = generated for Android devices
   * iOS = generated for Apple iOS devices

      PROTIP: It's better for reuse to not include the name of the app ("Droid" instead of "XWeather.Droid").

   * NuGet.config
   * Scripts
   * Shared
   * UITests
   * Unified
   * ____.sln = solution file for use by Visual Studio IDE
   <br /><br />

   PROTIP: Xamarin Studio stores projects using the Visual Studio .sln file format.
   So solution files are interchangeable between Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio regardless of IDE used.

   There are lots of files in each folder above.


   ### More sample app source

   https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples

   https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples


   ### References

   Within VS2017, the References folder within both Android and iOS projects contains:

   * System
   * System.Core
   * System.Xml
   <br /><br />

   Microsoft's .NET Base Class Library (BCL).

   In iOS projects the References folder also contains:

   * Xamarin.iOS
   <br /><br />
   
   In Android projects the References folder also contains:

   * Mono.Android
   <br /><br />
   

   ### Build and Error Review

0. Click the <strong>Build</strong> arrow icon at the top.



   The result is likely errors.   

0. Double-click on the red message for a list at the bottom of the screen.

0. Cursor to the top edge of the message pane so the cursor changes,
   then drag it up to see more lines.

   If there are no blocking errors, you'll see a message such as this:

   NOTES:

   The build process creates IL (Intermediate Language) code that is vendor neutral.
   IL code is defined by the .NET standards by ECMA (not ISO).

   Xmarin.iOS builds use AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation) to compile IL 
   into native ARM assembly code for compile into a native binary executable.

   Xamarin.Android builds use JIT (Just in Time Compilation) 
   to compiles IL into ___ and IPK executable loaded on Android devices.


   A UWP (Universal Windows Program) app runs on both Windows 10 and Windows 10 mobile without rework.
   It's not for Macs.


### New Library Project

Libraries are defined as separate projects.

0. Right-click on the Solution node and select Add > Add a New Project.

0. Under the Multiplatform category, select Library, then Shared Project in the right pane.
   Click Next.

0. Name the project "MyTunes.Shared" and click Create to create the project.

   SAPs are files named <strong>.shproj</strong>
   containing a group of source and assets referenced by each target project's code as if they were 
   individually added to the project, before build.

0. Click Create for template code to be created in a .cs (C#) file.


<a name="CompilerSymbols"></a>

### Solution compiler symbols and directives

0. In the solution pane, right-click on the solution's name (such as XWeather).<br />
   Select Options.

0. In the solution pane, right-click on project name XWeather.Droid.<br />
   Select Compiler.

   Field <strong>Define Symbols</strong> should contain:

   <pre>DEBUG;__ANDROID__;</pre>

   Such values are referenced by conditional compiler directives (shown below).

   Press Esc.

0. In the solution pane, right-click on project name XWeather.iOS.<br />
   Select Compiler.

   Field <strong>Define Symbols</strong> should contain:

   <pre>__UNIFIED__;__MOBILE__;__IOS__;DEBUG;ENABLE_TEST_CLOUD;</pre>

   Notice these values are for the <strong>Configuration:</strong> value
   at the top of the dialog. That's why the value "DEBUG" is there.

0. Click and hold on the value to Configuration: field and select <strong>Release</strong>.

   Field <strong>Define Symbols</strong> should now contain:

   <pre>__UNIFIED__;__MOBILE__;__IOS__;</pre>

0. Press Esc to cancel the dialog.


### Shared Asset Projects (SAPs)

   SAPs were introduced with Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 (April 2014) and Xamarin 5.
   
   Conditional compiler directives in the Shared code
   can direct the compiler to isolate platform-specific code based on 
   <a href="#CompilerSymbols">compiler symbols defined</a>
   defined in

   <pre>
   #if   __IOS__
       ...
   #elif __ANDROID__
       ...
   #elif WINDOWS_PHONE || WINDOWS_UWP
       ...
   #endif
   </pre>

   PROTIP: IOS is listed at the top because that is currently the most popular device type.

   PROTIP: In the code above, there is vertical alignment.

   An alternative is to make calls to a class that is defined in all platforms using 
   the same signature (number of parameters and data types referenced in the call).
   This is called "Class Mirroring".

   The C# language provides for <strong>partial classes and Methods</strong>
   to be defined for code generators to complete.

   SAPs replace PCLs

### PCLs (Platform Class Libraries)

   * View assemblies within a Profile at C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable\v4.5\Profile\Profile78\ 

   * TOOL: <a target="_blank" href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1177943e-cfb7-4822-a8a6-e56c7905292b">
   .NET Portability Analyzer</a>
   assesses whether an existing library can be converted to a PCL profile.

   ### Xamarin Components Store and Packages

   This applies to both Android and iOS projects.

0. In VS2017 a solution pane under a project, click <strong>Components</strong>.

0. Click the <strong>Open Component Store</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.

0. Sign-In using your Xamarin credentials because
   the Xamarin Component Store was created before NuGet to provide 
   <em>paid</em> support on components.

0. Press Esc to return to the IDE.

   Many components are published in both the Component Store and Microsoft's <strong>NuGet.org</strong>.

0. Click <strong>Packages</strong> on the solution pane.

   An Add Packages dialog appears.

0. Click and hold on Nuget.org.   

   You can configure additional sources of components, such as .NetFoundation.org.

0. Click Close.


   ### Additional Components

   When a Xamarin component is installed into an App project, it is placed in a 
   Components folder at the root level of the Solution folder. If you remove the Component from all projects in the solution, it will get removed from this folder as well. A copy is ALSO stored in a cache:

   On Windows: %LocalAppData%\Xamarin\Cache\Components

   On Mac: ~/Library/Caches/Xamarin/Components

   PROTIP: To remove a component completely from a machine, 
   delete it from your projects/solutions 
   AND from the cache folder.

   QUESTION: Code used across different platforms are stored in different "profiles".


   ### Assets

   DEFINITION: Assets include text and font files loaded by Android code such as:

   <pre>
   Typeface tf = Typeface.CreateFromAsset (Context.Assets, "fonts/samplefont.ttf");
   </pre>

   The above code calls methods in Android's AssetManager package.

   https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/getting-started/

   "Xamarin.Forms is a new library that enables you to build native UIs for iOS, Android and Windows Phone from a single, shared C# codebase. It provides more than 40 cross-platform controls and layouts which are mapped to native controls at runtime, which means that your user interfaces are fully native."

   UI controls are coded at a high level in C# for the library to render them as native counterparts
   in each platform.

   Xamarin.Forms controls are a wrapper on native controls, they aren't new controls themselves.

   v4 introduced a new SSH-based build host which replaces the old and buggy build host. 
   
   v3 introduced Xamarin.Forms supports Native UI development for iOS, Android, and Windows.

   ### Hanselman Forms #

0. Read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/XamarinFormsWriteOnceRunEverywhereANDBeNative.aspx">
   Scott Hanselman's blog about writing the library</a> May 2014.

   The app aggregates his web blog and tweets.

0. On your local Terminal, create a folder such as

### UI


   ## Profiles

   Code used across different platforms are stored in different "profiles".


   ### Plug-ins for Xamarin Forms #

   Gaps in Xamarin Forms functionality are filled by
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jamesmontemagno">
   https://github.com/jamesmontemagno</a> 
   by James Montemagno (@JamesMontemagno),
   Principal Program Manager for @Xamarin at Microsoft.

   * https://github.com/XLabs/Xamarin-Forms-Labs
   XLabs (no longer maintained) 
   was an open source project to provide a powerful and cross platform set of 
   services and controls tailored to work with Xamarin and Xamarin Forms.


   <a name="FancyControls"></a>

   ### Fancier Controls #

   PROTIP: If you want fancier UI and have $1000,
   consider the Infragistics Xamarin Forms library at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms">
   http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms</a>

   This is coded in a similar way and look similar as on other platforms.
   So it's good to keep up.

### Debugger

   https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/troubleshooting/questions/debugger-settings/

   <img width="175" alt="vs2017 debug options" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/21987593/69a24a4c-dbc1-11e6-9f45-bf4a81dc3c39.png">

   "SE" is the emulator.


### MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)

   MVVM (pronounced by spelling out the letters Em Vee Vee Em).
   
   In the <a target="_blank" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/XamarinShow">
   Xamarin Show</a>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.xamarin.com/the-xamarin-show-getting-started-with-mvvm/">
   on MVVM</a>, James Montemagno explains how,
   conceptually, MVVM enables developers to separate business logic from user interface code.

   Mono's UI is developed using XAML (pronounced Zam-mil).
   XAML is a variant of XML containing definitions of UI elements,
   much like Android XML. (iOS Storyboards)

   The XAML is referenced by "code behind" programming code that define behaviors.

   The code sets text properties, register for click handlers, and 
   automatically enable and disable controls with Commands.

   The data binding framework built into Xamarin.Forms.

   The programming language is Microsoft's <strong>C# version 6.0</strong>.



## Deploy

### Publish to OneDrive cloud

https://github.com/xamarin/publish-over-onedrive-plugin



<a name="HockeyApp"></a>

### Insights in HockeyApp #

HockeyApp at<br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hockeyapp.net/">
hockeyapp.net</a>
is a cloud-hosted solution for beta app distribution and
collection of real-time crash reports and user metrics and feedback.

Xamarin Insights is being merged into HockeyApp.


## Testing

Xamarin UITest is a Microsoft-only testing solution.

Some prefer <strong>Appium</strong> purely because it is an open source library
and thus a vendor-neutral approach.


<a name="XamarinTestCloud"></a>
   
### Xamarin Test Cloud 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/test-cloud#pricing">
   "Scale" level</a> provides 5 hours a day for 3 concurrent devices for<br />
   <strong>$3,865.50 per year</strong> ($379/month billed annually).

   $4,548 per year, after a 25% discount of $1,137, is <strong>$3,411</strong>.
  
   CAUTION: The lower "Start" level provides just one device for one hour per day,
   for $99/month. If you don't use it one day, you've donated the money to Microsoft.

   BTW, Microsoft acquired its Test Cloud from Karl Krukow (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/KarlKrukow">@KarlKrukow</a>, from Denmark, who built 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/">
   "Calabash</a>, an Automated UI Acceptance Testing framework for writing and executing tests 
   that validate the functionality of iOS and Android Apps using Cucumber and Ruby libraries.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/wXgnh2Q7Uv8">See him speak about Continuous Deployment</a>.)

   https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/ci/

   This now Microsoft offering may be low when compared against charges and additional setup needed to
   use alternatives such as Amazon's Test Cloud, 
   Perfecto, and others.

   PROTIP: Evaluate the cross-compatibility of test code. 
   Xamarin Test Cloud tests supports <strong>a different test framework for each language</strong>:

   * Ruby with the Calabash framework, 
   * C# with Xamarin.UITest, and 
   * Java via the Appium framework 

   * https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/troubleshooting/#The_Apple_App_Store_Rejected_My_iOS_App_Because_of_Non-public_API_Usage

   * https://github.com/xamarin/test-cloud-samples

   ### Alternative test clouds

   PROTIP: As with all cloud arrangements,
   have agreements in place to use alternative test clouds such as Amazon Device Cloud
   and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perfecto.com/">Perfecto</a>.

   Alternative test clouds may have a wider choice of devices.
   Most importantly, one cloud may have 
   <strong>new devices earlier</strong> than others.

   The Perfecto cloud offers a <strong>private</strong> option.
   On-premises test device vendors offer complete secrecy.
   And MSDN subscribers get a 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/dd347471.aspx">
   discount</a>.
