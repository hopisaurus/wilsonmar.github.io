This article currently contains my notes about installing and using Xamarin on Microsoft's IoT ecosystem.


## Overview #

Xamarin was an independent organization (in San Francisco) 
which charged $2000 per user per year per platform
(iOS, Android and Mac).

There are also charges for Xamarin Test Cloud and the
HockeyApp cloud-hosted solution for beta app distribution and
collection of real-time crash reports and user feedback.

Someone developing across 3 platforms would pay $5,000.

The HockeyApp ???

v3 introduced Xamarin.Forms supports Native UI development for iOS, Android and Windows 

v4 introduced a new SSH-based build host which replaces the old and buggy build host. 
It connects Visual Studio and Mac for building and deploying iOS apps.

<strong>Mono</strong> is the run-time engine that should be equivalent to 
Microsoft's .NET Core on other platforms.

This was a major impediment until Microsoft bought it Feb. 2016.
and at Build 2016, announced that Xamarin would be a free part of Visual Studio & MSDN subscribers.
And Xamarin Studio is no longer available on Windows.

Mac users would need an Enterprise Visual Studio license, at $2500 per year.
Ask at hello@xamarin.com or by phone +1 (855) 926-2746.

Xamarin Studio stores projects using the Visual Studio .sln file format.
So solution files are interchangeable between Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio regardless of IDE used.

See https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/license/

## Homebrew #

<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=xamarin">
In StackOverflow</a> 
are several complaints about brew issues.

One suggested installing mono-mdk instead of mono from homebrew.

brew cask install mono-mdk
You can also modify your PATH to use mono-mdk's binary:

export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:$PATH 


## Installation on Mac #

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/downloads/hh442898.aspx">

   at the Xamarin Store.

0. Login to IDE with Xamarin Account.

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/download">
