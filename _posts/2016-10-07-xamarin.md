{% include _toc.html %}

This article currently contains my notes about installing and using 
Microsoft's Xamarin app development Framework which use Microsoft's 
C# language to write both iOS and Android Apps.

TODO: My objective is to build a "Hello World" sample app code that 
compiles and builds from a single command,
while I learn to be a Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer.
Right now (January 2017), none of the samples "Just Work".


## Run-times on mobile #

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono-project</a> 
is the run-time engine equivalent to 
Microsoft's .NET Core on other platforms. 
It implements .NET APIs and plays with .NET Standard so you donâ€™t have to worry about the implmentation under the hood.
In fact, there is a single .NET super optmized runtime that brings 
.NET to iOS, Android, macOS, Apple tvOS, IoT, Linux, PS4, Xbox, etc. 

   Some marketing materials say "15%-30%" of all code is shared among platforms.
   But you'll need to see for yourself.

Examples of device platform-specific code include access to:

   * system information (such as battery life)
   * personal information (such as device name)
   * folders and files on the device
   * external devices (such as Bluetooth)
   * notifications
   <br /><br />


Mono's UI is developed using XAML (a variant of XML to define UI elements)
referenced by "code behind" written in Microsoft's <strong>C# version 6.0</strong> programming language
that define behaviors.

   PROTIP: Jumping into a platform is a rather big career decision.
   Few people have time to be expert in tools for several languages.
   The fragmentation in Java and Android tools makes it difficult to be quickly productive when moving jobs
   since there are so many variations of tools to master.
   Even though Microsoft does limit and change (abandon) technologies over time,
   their ecosystem offers more focused training resources and help for learners make it easier to master
   and provides better movement among employers. My two cents.

## Pre-built apps in Azure cloud

CAUTION: This section under construction:

Even before software is installed locally,
experience a pre-built app running live on Microsoft's cloud at:

## Pricing of solution components #

The home page for Xamarin is <a target="_blank" href="https://xamarin.com/">
   xamarin.com</a>. Click on <strong>Products</strong>.

   ![xamarin ecosystem 20161025](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/19684717/0c2e3880-9a76-11e6-9e3a-744d0218d5e1.png)

   Let's review the components by looking at pricing as well while 
   we install the software.

   PROTIP: It costs <strong>$11,759.50</strong> per person
   to use the entire ecosystem the first year.

   * $5,999 for Visual Studio Enterprise
   * $995 for education
   * $3,865.50 to test 3 devices
   * $0 for <a href="#HockeyApp">deployment and crash monitoring</a>
   * $1,000 for optional <a href="#FancyControls">fancy controls</a>

## Xamarin Platform IDEs #

   "Platform" here refers to the tools to develop software.

   An Apple Mac machine is needed only to compile code to run on Apple iOS devices.
   But one can be shared. And the MacInCloud service can be used.

   NOTE: Xamarin Studio is no longer available on Windows.

   <strong>Parallels</strong> software, not being true virtualization, 
   is an advantage is this case.
   On a Mac, one can install <strong>Parallels</strong> software,
   then install Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 for Windows inside that,
   and you'll be able to run Windows Phone emulators as well.
   
   PROTIP: Windows Phone is dead anyway in 2016.
   So this approach is not recommended.

0. Install Apple's XCode on your Mac's App Store.

   NOTE: Each version is related to a specific version of the Apple OS Mac operating system.

   https://github.com/xamarin/Homebrew-Formulas
   provides a Tap for Xamarin-specific Homebrew formulas

### Visual Studio on Mac #

   PROTIP: Although Xamarin Studio is currently offered,
   its functonality is being folded into 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">
   Visual Studio 2017 for Mac</a>, free in Preview until May 31, 2017.

   I predict in the future this will become a paid Visual Studio Enterprise for Mac.

0. Click to download <strong>VisualStudioforMacPreviewInstaller.dmg</strong>,
   22.8 MB.

0. Skip to follow <a href="#MacInstall">these same instructions</a>.


### Xamarin Studio on Mac #


0. Buy the MSDN subscription with an email you'll be using to build software.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/">
   https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing</a> says 
   Visual Studio Enterprise is<br />
   <strong>$5,999</strong> for the first year and then each additional year<br />
   $2,569</a>.

   However, Mac users now still need an <strong>Enterprise Visual Studio</strong> 
   license.

0. Use the email you used to get your license to login MSDN.com,
   Subscriptions at:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900">
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900</a>.

0. Scroll down to <strong>Xamarin Studio (for OSX)</strong> and 
   click "Register and Download".

   NOTE: Xamarin was an independent organization (in San Francisco) 
   which charged <strong>$5,697 per user per year per platform</strong>

   * Xamarin.Android Visual Studio Enterprise 
   * Xamarin.iOS Visual Studio Enterprise
   * Xamarin.Mac Visual Studio Enterprise
   <br /><br />

   See https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/license/

0. Create a Xamarin account if you don't already have one.
   Click Subscribe.

   Microsoft bought Xamarin in Feb. 2016
   and (at Build 2016), so there is still a separate system.

   PROTIP: Notice it's an annual renewal.

   PROTIP: Work on Xamarin Studio has stopped on Windows.
   Microsoft is working on a Visual Studio for Mac.

0. Click on the "Download Now" on this page.

0. During VS installation, under 
   <strong>Cross Platform Mobile Development</strong>,
   choose <strong>Custom</strong> and
   select feature <strong>C#/.NET (Xamarin) [3rd Party]</strong>.

   <!-- If you already have VS installed, go to the Control Panel 
   and change the features. -->

0. PROTIP: Before you begin, make sure you have enough disk space.
   The whole install will be shown as near 3 GB (2.2 GB they say).

0. PROTIP: Since different versions of installers have the same name,
   XamarinInstaller.dmg, change the name downloaded with a date such as
   
   <pre>XamarinInstaller_2016.10.24.dmg</pre> takes 22.2 MB according to my Finder.

0. Double-click on it in your Downloads folder to expand.

   <a name="MacInstall"></a>

   ### Mac instructions #

0. Double-click the big down-arrow orange icon to open another window.
   If you don't see the new window press command+tab and tab to the orange icon.

0. Check the checkbox and click Accept.

0. Click on Dependencies and unselect the <strong>components</strong> you don't want, then
   click Continue.

   Notice the disk space usage (242 MB) and path (with "mac" subsituted for your account name):

   <tt><strong>
   /Users/mac/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx
   </strong></tt>

0. Click Continue.
0. Click Install.
0. Check "I agree" to the Licenses, then Continue.

   PROTIP: You'll be prompted several times to enter your Mac user's password.
   So don't walk off.

0. View the <a href="#WhileWaiting">While Waiting</a> section.


### Visual Studio on Windows #

   Those developing on Windows machines work on iPhone by
   running a remote session on a Mac through a cable and running SSH.

   NOTE: Since mobile devices will need to use virtualization,
   the IDE can't also be running in a virtualized environment such as
   VMWare Fusion.

   NOTE: Installation includes 
   Xamarin Mac Agent (previously called the Xamarin Build Host).
   Its use includes enabling Remote Login on the Mac
   on the same Network subnet with the Mac's IP address.


   There is a free "Community" edition of Visual Studio on Windows.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/compare-visual-studio/">
   But the Community edition doesn't include support</a>.

0. Go to<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/download/">
   https://www.xamarin.com/download</a>.

0. Create an account or SignIn.

   PROTIP: Many open several accounts for this to get around 
   Microsoft's 30-day trial limits plus 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://store.xamarin.com/account/my/subscription/redeemextension">
   redeeming</a> a 30 day extension approval.

   ### Pre-built apps

   https://www.xamarin.com/prebuilt

   PROTIP: Instead of clicking to download one or more of the Forms apps,
   first install the app without building from source code from 
   https://github.com/xamarin/app-crm/wiki/Install-the-app-NOW-without-building-from-source-code

   On the right panel it displays a set of sample apps for download as zips

   ### Development approaches

   PROTIP: The types of development approaches:

   * Silo approach of writing Objective-C code for iOS and Java code for Android provided by vendors.
   This requires different developer teams.

   * Black Box takes a single (HTML/JavaScript) code base to create multiple apps with 
   "minimum common" features common across the platforms.

   * Xamarin Forms 

   Xamarin Forms is simpler to program, but you might run into a "brick wall"
   when you need to re-code using the native coding approach.
   But if you can live with eventual limitations,
   Forms is a quick way to get to an app quickly.


### Libraries

PCLs (Platform Class Libraries).

   * View assemblies within a Profile at C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable\v4.5\Profile\Profile78\ 

   * TOOL: <a target="_blank" href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1177943e-cfb7-4822-a8a6-e56c7905292b">
   .NET Portability Analyzer</a>
   assesses whether an existing library can be converted to a PCL profile.

Shared Asset Projects (SAPs) use conditional compiler directives.
It was introduced with Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 (April 2014).

Xmarin.iOS uses AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation) which takes IL and compiles it into native code with the intention of executing the resulting binary file natively.

Xamarin.Android uses JIT (Just in Time Compilation) which takes IL and compiles it preperation for running as native code.

When a Xamarin component is installed into an App project, it is placed in a 
Components folder at the root level of the Solution folder. If you remove the Component from all projects in the solution, it will get removed from this folder as well. A copy is ALSO stored in a cache:

   On Windows: %LocalAppData%\Xamarin\Cache\Components

   On Mac: ~/Library/Caches/Xamarin/Components

   So to remove a component completely, delete it from your projects/solutions 
   AND from the cache folder.


Code used across different platforms are stored in different "profiles".



### Xamarin Components Store

This was created before NuGet to provide paid supported components.

It's available from the Components > Get More Components folder of each project.

Many components are published in both this and Microsoft's NuGet.

   https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/getting-started/

   "Xamarin.Forms is a new library that enables you to build native UIs for iOS, Android and Windows Phone from a single, shared C# codebase. It provides more than 40 cross-platform controls and layouts which are mapped to native controls at runtime, which means that your user interfaces are fully native."

   UI controls are coded at a high level in C# for the library to render them as native counterparts
   in each platform.

   Xamarin.Forms controls are a wrapper on native controls, they aren't new controls themselves.

   v4 introduced a new SSH-based build host which replaces the old and buggy build host. 
   
   v3 introduced Xamarin.Forms supports Native UI development for iOS, Android, and Windows.

   ### Hanselman Forms #

0. Read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/XamarinFormsWriteOnceRunEverywhereANDBeNative.aspx">
   Scott Hanselman's blog about writing the library</a> May 2014.

   The app aggregates his web blog and tweets.

0. On your local Terminal, create a folder such as

   <pre>~/gits/wilsonmar/Hanselman.Forms</pre>

0. Got to Hanselman's Form app code repo 

   https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Hanselman.Forms

0. Fork it to your own GitHub account.

0. Clone your edition of Hanselman's Form app code (instead of "jamesmontemagno"):

   <pre><strong>
   git clone https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Hanselman.Forms --depth=1
   </strong></pre>


   ### Structure of folders and files

   After an analysis of various examples, XWeather has what I think the most comprehensible structure for
   folders and files. Here's the tree from root of the app folder:

   * .gitignore
   * images/____.png for the app's sample UI image for display in the store
   * README.md

   Within the XWeather (alphabetically):
   Code for .Droid and .iOS are generated automatically.

   * Droid = generated for Android devices
   * iOS = generated for Apple iOS devices
   * NuGet.config

   PROTIP: Xamarin Studio stores projects using the Visual Studio .sln file format.
   So solution files are interchangeable between Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio regardless of IDE used.

   There are lots of files in each folder above.

### Blank app

0. Select "Blank App (Xmarin.Forms Portable)".

   QUESTION: How does this address the issue of the UI look and feel,
   such as button placement, etc. as defined by Google and Apple
   being very different?


## Profiles

   Code used across different platforms are stored in different "profiles".


## Plug-ins for Xamarin Forms #

   Gaps in Xamarin Forms functionality are filled by
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jamesmontemagno">
   https://github.com/jamesmontemagno</a> 
   by James Montemagno (@JamesMontemagno),
   Principal Program Manager for @Xamarin at Microsoft.

   * https://github.com/XLabs/Xamarin-Forms-Labs
   XLabs (no longer maintained) 
   was an open source project to provide a powerful and cross platform set of 
   services and controls tailored to work with Xamarin and Xamarin Forms.


   <a name="FancyControls"></a>

## Fancier Controls #

   PROTIP: If you want fancier UI and have $1000,
   consider the Infragistics Xamarin Forms library at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms">
   http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms</a>

   This is coded in a similar way and look similar as on other platforms.
   So it's good to keep up.

<!--
## Homebrew Mono #

<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=xamarin">
In StackOverflow</a> 
are several complaints about brew issues.

0. Rather than manually download the installer from 
   https://xamarin.com,
   installing mono-mdk instead of mono from homebrew.

   ```
   brew cask install mono-mdk
   ```

You can also modify your PATH to use mono-mdk's binary:

export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:$PATH

## Debugger

## Publish to OneDrive cloud

<a name="XamarinTestCloud"></a>
   
## Xamarin Test Cloud 

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/test-cloud#pricing">
   "Scale" level</a> provides 5 hours a day for 3 concurrent devices for<br />
   <strong>$3,865.50 per year</strong> ($379/month billed annually).

   $4,548 per year, after a 25% discount of $1,137, is <strong>$3,411</strong>.
  
   CAUTION: The lower "Start" level provides just one device for one hour per day,
   for $99/month. If you don't use it one day, you've donated the money to Microsoft.

   BTW, Microsoft acquired its Test Cloud from Karl Krukow (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/KarlKrukow">@KarlKrukow</a>, from Denmark, who built 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/">
   "Calabash</a>, an Automated UI Acceptance Testing framework for writing and executing tests 
   that validate the functionality of iOS and Android Apps using Cucumber and Ruby libraries.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/wXgnh2Q7Uv8">See him speak about Continuous Deployment</a>.)

   https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/ci/

   This now Microsoft offering may be low when compared against charges and additional setup needed to
   use alternatives such as Amazon's Test Cloud, 
   Perfecto, and others.

   PROTIP: Evaluate the cross-compatibility of test code. 
   Xamarin Test Cloud tests supports <strong>a different test framework for each language</strong>:

   * Ruby with the Calabash framework, 
   * C# with Xamarin.UITest, and 
   * Java via the Appium framework 

   * https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/troubleshooting/#The_Apple_App_Store_Rejected_My_iOS_App_Because_of_Non-public_API_Usage

   * https://github.com/xamarin/test-cloud-samples

   ### Alternative test clouds

   PROTIP: As with all cloud arrangements,
   have agreements in place to use alternative test clouds such as Amazon Device Cloud
   and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perfecto.com/">Perfecto</a>.

   Alternative test clouds may have a wider choice of devices.
   Most importantly, one cloud may have 
   <strong>new devices earlier</strong> than others.

   The Perfecto cloud offers a <strong>private</strong> option.
   On-premises test device vendors offer complete secrecy.
   And MSDN subscribers get a 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/dd347471.aspx">
   discount</a>.
