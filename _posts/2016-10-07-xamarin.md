This article currently contains my notes about installing and using Xamarin on Microsoft's IoT ecosystem.


## Run-times on mobile #

<strong>Mono</strong> is the run-time engine equivalent to 
Microsoft's .NET Core on other platforms.

It is developed using XAML (a variant of XML to define UI elements)
and Microsoft's <strong>C# version 6.0</strong> programming language and tools.

   PROTIP: It's a rather big career decision.
   Few people have time to be expert in tools for several languages.

## Install and pricing from MSDN #

0. The home page for Xamarin is <a target="_blank" href="https://xamarin.com/">
   xamarin.com</a>. Click on <strong>Products</strong>.

   ![xamarin ecosystem 20161025](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/19684717/0c2e3880-9a76-11e6-9e3a-744d0218d5e1.png)

   Let's review the components by looking at pricing as well while 
   we install the software.

   PROTIP: It costs <strong>$11,859.50</strong> per person
   to use the entire ecosystem the first year.

   * $5,999 for Visual Studio Enterprise
   * $1,995 for education
   * $3,865.50 to test 3 devices
   * $0 for <a href="#HockeyApp">deployment and crash monitoring</a>
   <br /><br />
   PROTIP: Some Microsoft resellers online give discounts.

   The test cost is actually low when compared aginst standard rates from
   Perfecto, Amazon Device Cloud, etc.

   ### Xamarin Platform #

   "Platform" here refers to the tools to develop software.

   PROTIP: Different IDEs are installed and used on Windows and Mac.

   <img width="646" alt="xamarin studios 20161025" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/19685008/920536ec-9a77-11e6-94a0-2fac50b0a303.png">

   NOTE: Xamarin Studio is no longer available on Windows.

   PROTIP: Don't click on "Download Now" on the marketing page,
   but on MSDN as described below.


   ### Visual Studio on Windows #

   Those developing on Windows machines work on iPhone by
   running a remote session on a Mac through a cable.

   NOTE: Since mobile devices will need to use virtualization,
   the IDE can't also be running in a virtualized environment such as
   VMWare Fusion.

   NOTE: Installation includes 
   Xamarin Mac Agent (previously called the Xamarin Build Host).
   Its use includes enabling Remote Login on the Mac
   on the same Network subnet with the Mac's IP address.


   There is a free "Community" edition of Visual Studio on Windows.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/compare-visual-studio/">
   But the Community edition doesn't include support</a>.

0. Go to<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/download/">
   https://www.xamarin.com/download</a>

0. Select Product and Xamarin Platform.
   Click "Download now for free".

   It recognizes what operating system you're using 
   based on what browser you used to visit the site.

0. Fill out the form to begin downloading.

0. Obtain a VS 2015 Community Edition web
   installer from https://visualstudio.com.

0. Run the downloader and it downloads the rest.

0. From your Downloads folder, invoke the downloaded .exe.

   Skip to <a href="#PostInstall">post-install below</a>
   if you are not installing on a Mac.


   ### Xamarin Studio on Mac #

   <strong>Parallels</strong> software is not true virtualization.
   On a Mac, one can install <strong>Parallels</strong> software,
   then install Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 for Windows inside that,
   and you'll be able to run Windows Phone emulators as well.
   
   PROTIP: Windows Phone is dead anyway in 2016.
   So this approach is not recommended.

0. Buy the MSDN subscription with an email you'll be using to build software.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/">
   https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing</a> says 
   Visual Studio Enterprise is<br />
   <strong>$5,999</strong> for the first year and then each additional year<br />
   $2,569</a>.

   However, Mac users now still need an <strong>Enterprise Visual Studio</strong> 
   license.


0. Use the email you used to get your license to login MSDN.com,
   Subscriptions at:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900">
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/hh442900</a>.

0. Scroll down to <strong>Xamarin Studio (for OSX)</strong> and 
   click "Register and Download".

   NOTE: Xamarin was an independent organization (in San Francisco) 
   which charged <strong>$5,697 per user per year</strong>
   for the 3 platforms:

   * Xamarin.Android Visual Studio Enterprise 
   * Xamarin.iOS Visual Studio Enterprise
   * Xamarin.Mac Visual Studio Enterprise

   Ask at hello@xamarin.com or by phone +1 (855) 926-2746.

   See https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/license/

0. Create a Xamarin account if you don't already have one.
   Click Subscribe.

   Microsoft bought Xamarin in Feb. 2016
   and (at Build 2016), so there is still a separate system.

   PROTIP: Notice it's an annual renewal.

   PROTIP: Work on Xamarin Studio has stopped on Windows.
   So Microsoft is likely working on a Visual Studio for Mac.
   Until that becomes available, do the following.

0. Click on the "Download Now" on this page.

0. During VS installation, under 
   <strong>Cross Platform Mobile Development</strong>,
   choose <strong>Custom</strong> and
   select feature <strong>C#/.NET (Xamarin) [3rd Party]</strong>.

   If you already have VS installed, go to the Control Panel 
   and change the features.


0. PROTIP: Since different versions of installers have the same name,
   XamarinInstaller.dmg, change the name downloaded with a date such as
   
   XamarinInstaller_2016.10.24

   The one I downloaded took up 22.2 MB according to my Finder.

0. Double-click on it to expand.
0. Double-click XamarinInstaller_2016.10.24.dmg to open it.
0. Double-click the orange icon to open another window.
   If you don't see the new window press command+tab and tab to the orange icon.
0. Click Continue to accept the download of all run-times.
0. Check the Accept and Continue.

   Notice the disk space usage (1.76 GB) and path:

   <tt><strong>
   /Users/mac/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx
   </strong></tt>

0. Acknowledge the versions and click Continue.

0. PROTIP: On the "Install" pop-up screen, 
   click the red X at the upper-left corner to dismiss it.

0. PROTIP: You'll be prompted several times to enter your Mac user's password.
   So don't walk off.

0. While you wait visit other pages to
   sign up for:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://store.xamarin.com/o?item=XU%20SUB">
   Xamarin University Mobile Training</a> (selected class videos and materials)
   for Microsoft Visual Studio is<br />
   <strong>$1,995 per year</strong> per person
   after <strong>30 days</strong>. Tick tock.

   * Xamarin Test Cloud 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xamarin.com/test-cloud#pricing">
   "Scale" level</a> provides 5 hours a day for 3 concurrent devices for<br />
   <strong>$3,865.50 per year</strong> (billed annually).

   $4,548 per year, after a 25% discount of $1,137, is <strong>$3,411</strong>.
  
   The lower "Start" level provides just one device for one hour per day,
   for $99/month.

   This is low when compared against charges and additional setup needed to
   use alternatives such as Amazon's Test Cloud or 
   Perfecto.


   ### Finish installation

0. When "Installation complete" appears, click "Quit".

0. PROTIP: In Finder left-click the XamarinInstaller_2016.10.24.dmg file
   to move it to Trash and in the left menu eject the "Xamarin Installer".
   Also clean out your Trash can to recover disk space.

0. Draw 3 fingers together on the touchpad and click "X" for Xamarin.

0. PROTIP: If you're going to be using it a lot,
   drag and drop the icon to the bottom of the screen.

The above only needs to be done once.

   ### Post-install #


## Create Project #

0. Click <strong>New Project</strong>.
0. Select under <strong>Visual C#</strong> the
   <strong>Cross-Pltform</strong>.
0. Select "Blank App (Xmarin.Forms Portable)".

   PROTIP: Xamarin Studio stores projects using the Visual Studio .sln file format.
   So solution files are interchangeable between Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio regardless of IDE used.

   PROTIP: Notice in the Solution Explorer code for .Droid and .iOS
   are generated automatically.

   QUESTION: How does this address the issue of the UI look and feel,
   such as button placement, etc. as defined by Google and Apple
   being very different?


   ### Xamarin Forms #

   v4 introduced a new SSH-based build host which replaces the old and buggy build host. 
   
   v3 introduced Xamarin.Forms supports Native UI development for iOS, Android, and Windows.


## Fancier Controls #

PROTIP: If you want fancier UI and have $1000,
consider the Infragistics Xamarin Forms library at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms">
http://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin-forms</a>

This is coded in a similar way and look similar as on other platforms.
So it's good to keep up.

<!--
## Homebrew Mono #

<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=xamarin">
In StackOverflow</a> 
are several complaints about brew issues.

0. Rather than manually download the installer from 
   https://xamarin.com,
   installing mono-mdk instead of mono from homebrew.

   ```
   brew cask install mono-mdk
   ```

You can also modify your PATH to use mono-mdk's binary:

export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:$PATH 
-->
