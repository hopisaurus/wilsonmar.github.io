EasyTravel is a "realistic heterogeneous multi-tier web-application"
Dynatrace provides to evaluate its AppMon and UEM software.

(What we're referring to here is NOT a real travel site like Expedia.com or
http://www.easytravel.co.tz)

## Using Windows to work on a MacOSX

## Using Linux

From <a target="_blank" href="https://answers.dynatrace.com/questions/148613/how-to-start-easytravel-demo-on-linux.html?childToView=175003#answer-175003">this</a>:

It seems you run a 64-bit Ubuntu installation, but easyTravel does not fully support this with the 32-bit binaries that are provided on the community pages.

You can either run easyTravel on an Ubuntu 32-bit installation 
or use the Web-based launcher via the following commands:

cd weblauncher

./weblauncher.sh

This will provide a web-based view which should provide the same interfaces as the rich-client UI.

Please note that on 64-bit Linux, you likely need to run the following commands to install some additional 32-bit components that are needed by easyTravel:

   <pre>
sudo apt-get update 
sudo aptitude install gcc-multilib 
sudo apt-get install libxml2:i386 
sudo aptitude install lib32z1 
sudo apt-get install libcurl3:i386 
   </pre>

If you do not get libxml2:i386 you have to enable multilib support first:

   <pre>
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 sudo apt-get update
   </pre>

0. Launch servers under test

   The starting of the various tiers and the enabling/disabling of different problem pattern plugins is done via a separate easyTravel Launcher. The Launcher allows the user to conveniently switch between different demo scenarios. Each scenario can define load scripts and certain problem pattern plugins that are enabled. The scenarios can be modified or extended by changing an XML file. This is useful when giving demos and allows you to focus on <em>problem areas</em> that are particularly relevant for a specific demo.

   The default:
