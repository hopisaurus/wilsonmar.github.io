### Deprecated 410 Gone response

Submitting this:

yields this with a 410 Gone HTTP response code:

    This API has been deprecated. Please upgrade to our new APIs: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/migration-guide/


## Format of response file type

Currently, three output formats are available:

* XML (such as https://www.usa.gov/api/USAGovAPI/contacts.xml/contacts)
   is now considered old-school because

* JSON (such as https://www.usa.gov/api/USAGovAPI/contacts.json/contacts)

* JSONP (such as https://www.usa.gov/api/USAGovAPI/contacts.jsonp/contacts?callback=callmemaybe). When requesting JSONP, you should include a callback parameter with the name of the callback function you would like called.

* YML

* CSV for import into Excel and other spreadsheets

* Google Sheet referenced by data processors
