Although Selenium was created for functional testing on browsers,
such automation enables repeatedly run through web pages 
with the timing I want as I record screencast videos.


## Install dependencies 

This assumes that you've followed my tutorial on [installing Selenium](selenium-setup)
and now have on your laptop:

1. [Java](/java-on-apple-mac-osx/)
2. [Maven](/maven-on-macos/)
4. Firefox browser
5. Chrome with ChromeDriver

## Two Flex Frameworks

First of all, there are two "Flex" frameworks: Adobe and Apache.

Before WebSockets provided asynchronous communications and HTML5 provides rich animations,
Adobe had Flex via their proprietary AMF (Action Message Format) protocol. 
They both enable <strong>binary format</strong> transmissions
that serialize object graphs such as <strong>ActionScript</strong> objects and XML.

   Flex sends messages between an Adobe Flash client and a remote service running on a server, 
   usually a <strong>Flash Media Server</strong> or third party alternatives.

A big reason for HTML5 creation and wide adoption is to avoid browser plug-ins such as Flash.

   Current Flex projects are tied to either the Adobe Flash Player or Adobe AIR. 
   Apache devs are working to compile projects to native JavaScript in order to
   bypass the Flash Player in the browser.
   <a target="_blank" href="http://flex.apache.org/dev-faq.html">*</a>

   The Flash compiler combines MXML (layout) documents with ActionScript files to output a SWF application
   file that are downloaded to client browsers running the Adobe Flash Player.
   Or compile it with Adobe AIR to make native applications on Windows, MacOSX, Android, iOS, or BlackBerry platforms.

There are differences between the Apache and Adobe version of the SDK. 
Most notably, the Flash Player does not cache RSLs created with Apache Flex.

## History

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex

In 2002, Flash MX was released by Macromedia as the first RIA (Rich Internet Application)
development platform. Flash Player 7 used ActionScript 1.0.

In 2004, Flex 1.0 was released with ActionScript 2.0.
Flex Builder 1.0 was based on the Adobe Dreamweaver code base.

In 2006, Flex 2.0 was released with ActionScrpt 3.0, a true object-oriented language.
Built-in was Flex Builder 2 is based on Eclipse.

In 2008, Flex 3.0 added support for desktop apps with Adobe AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime).
It came with Flex Profiler for debugging.
Bundled in was visual controls such as AdvancedDataGrid and OLAPDataGrid.
These are now the older <strong>MX</strong> component set.

In 2008 
https://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Download%20Flex%203/

In 2010, Flex 4.0 with Flash Builder added a new component set architecture, 
<strong>Spark</strong>, for skinning
and Flash Player 10's Flash Text Engine (FTE)
and Flash Text Player Framework (TLF). New code generation features.

In November, 2011, Adobe announced they no longer support Adobe Flex. 
Instead of killing it, they donated the framework to Apache. Apache Flex 4.8 is essentially the same version of Flex as Adobe's last official version. 

All this to say that:

   CAUTION: Flash Builder 4 
   must use the older Carbon pure-C API architecture as it
   is not compatible with Apple's newer Cocoa Objective-C architecture 
   evolved from the Next-Step framework as the native API on Mac OS X and iOS Cocoa Touch.
   Its package Contents folder contains a "MacOSClassic" folder.

Adobe Flash Builder 4.7
adds support for <strong>64-bit</strong> and
using the open source  <strong>Apache Flex</strong> framework for mobile apps.
It works with Eclipseâ„¢ 4.2 and
ActionScript Compiler 2.0.

Apache Flex 4.9 is the first release since becoming a top level project of the 
Apache Software Foundation.
 
Apache Flex FalconJX

On July 28, 2014, Adobe Flex 4.13 was released.

On Jan 11, 2016, Apache Flex 4.15 was released.

### Free multi-platform development

http://flex.apache.org/doc-getstarted.html#setupFDT

http://flex.apache.org/installer.html

Adobe AIR allows you to make Apple iOS Applications from a Windows PC. 
But you still need a Mac to submit the app to Apple.

Adobe AIR requires each client machine running it to have an AIR client downloaded to it.

Using Adobe AIR with Apache Flex enables a single code base to be used to produce applications for submission to the Apple App Store,Apple Mac App Store, Android Market,  and Blackberry App World. 

There are very successful projects that have been submitted to all of the above. 

This allows you to use the SDK and any outputs of the SDK for personal and commercial use with virtually no restrictions. Some of the recommended tooling (not produced by Apache) costs money, however you are more than free to use the included command-line compilers and toolsets.
