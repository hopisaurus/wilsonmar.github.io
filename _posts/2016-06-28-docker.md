The object of this tutorial is to succintly present, 
with step-by-step instructions (but without much marketing hype),
how to setup and make use of Docker on Mac OSX.

## Flavors #

## Download #

Docker was originally created for different flavors of Linux

   * Ubuntu
   * CentOS
   * etc.

The version of Linux that comes with Mac isn't compatible. 
So an extra layer needs to emulate a Docker host, 
and that’s <strong>Boot2Docker</strong> from
https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/tag/v1.6.0.


On https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/

0. If your Mac has OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite or newer, (as of June 2016)
   <strong>Docker on Mac</strong>
   runs as a native Mac application and uses 
   xhyve to virtualize the Docker Engine environment 
   HyperKit VM from
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/docker/HyperKit/">
                            https://github.com/docker/HyperKit/</a>

   VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 must NOT be installed (it is incompatible with Docker for Mac). Docker for Mac will error out on install in this case. Uninstall the older version of VirtualBox and re-try the install.

0. From <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/">
   https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac</a>
   click on the link to download file <strong>Docker.dmg</strong> 

Alternately, if 

0. In Finder, navigate to you Download folder to double-click
<strong>Docker.dmg</strong> from
113.5 MB.


   | Date          | Version           | Download | Folder   |
   | ------------- | ----------------- | -------: | -------: | 
   | June 17, 2016 | 1.12.0-rc2-beta16 | 113.5 MB | 224.4 MB |

0. Double-click on Docker.dmg
0. Drag and drop.



0. Click Open.



0. Click Next.



0. Click OK.
0. Input Apple password.
0. Click Got it!.


Alternatively, 
   install with Homebrew and cask it’s even easier.

   Linux kernel-specific features for the Docker daemon.

   Alternately, Docker 0.8 or newer can be run on Macs 
   thanks to a specially developed, lightweight VirtualBox VM. 

   <pre>
   brew install docker
   brew install boot2docker
   </pre>



   ## Modules installed #

   The installation provides: 

   * Docker Engine, 
   * Docker CLI client, 
   * Docker Compose, and 
   * Docker Machine.

   * Docker Swarm.



   ## Verify install #

0. Open a Terminal shell window.

   <tt><strong>
   docker version
   </strong></tt>

   NOTE: No dash in front of version (unlike many Ruby commands).

   Sample response:

    <pre>
Client:
Version:      1.12.0-rc2
API version:  1.24
Go version:   go1.6.2
Git commit:   906eacd
Built:        Fri Jun 17 20:35:33 2016
OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64
Experimental: true
&nbsp;
Server:
Version:      1.12.0-rc2
API version:  1.24
Go version:   go1.6.2
Git commit:   a7119de

   </pre>

0. See the list of supported drivers at<br />
   https://docs. docker.com/machine/drivers/.



<a name="DockerUCP"></a>

## Docker UCP (Universal Control Plane) #

UCP enables you to control your Docker environment through a web interface, which is
helpful if you want to steer clear of the command line. 

You can use Docker UCP to deploy to various cloud solutions, tie into your existing authentication infrastructure, and in turn control user access.
More information about Docker UCP can be found at https://docs.docker.com/ ucp/.



<a name="DockerSearch"></a>

## DockerHub Search #

0. search for an ubuntu image on the free and public repository at 
   https://hub.docker.com.

   <tt><strong>docker search ubuntu</strong></tt>

   Alternately, a more secure commercial (paid) repository is at<br /> 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-trusted-registry">
   https://www.docker.com/products/docker-trusted-registry</a>

   A third alternative is<br >
   https://docs.docker.com/registry

0. Pull down the ubuntu image from the tutum repository:

   <tt><strong>docker pull ubuntu</strong></tt>

To remove an image:

   docker rmi ubuntu:trusty

0. Run the latest version image pulled for nginx:

   docker run -i -t nginx:latest /bin/bash


<a name="DockerMachine"></a>

## docker-machine #

0. Type the command by itself for a list of sub-commands:

   <tt><strong>
   docker-machine
   </strong></tt>

0. Widen the Terminal window so lines don't wrap.

0. List Docker machines available:

   docker-machine ls

0. Create a Docker machine named node1 in the local Virtualbox:

   docker-machine create -d virtualbox node1


<a name="DockerCompose"></a>

## Docker Compose #

See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.

To create multiple containers with a single command. 

0. Type the command by itself for a list of sub-commands:

   <tt><strong>
   docker-compose
   </strong></tt>

   An example docker-compose.yml  le is as follows:



<a name="DockerSwarm"></a>

## Docker Swarm #

Docker Swarm allows you to create and manage <strong>clustered</strong> Docker servers. 
to scale containers
by dispersing containers across multiple hosts.

Installing Docker Swarm launches a container that is used as
the Swarm Manager master to communicate to all the nodes in a Swarm cluster.

See https://docs.docker.com/swarm/



## .dockerignore #

.dockerignore is like a .gitignore file,
but specifies items to ignore in the Docker file.



## docker build --help #

   <tt><strong>
   docker build --help
   </strong></tt>



## Additional notes:

Docker does have different security requirements which will be a hindrance for Shippable. 
Security can be integrated but it does require knowledge of the Linux container environment.
