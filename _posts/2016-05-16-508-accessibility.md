<h2>HTML 508 Accessibility, importance, tools, videos and basic code suggestions.</h2>

This post explains how to verify whether websites are "508 Compliant". 
Compliance is to regulations requiring websites to be accessible to the deaf, hard-of-hearing, and visually impaired.

## Why is this needed?

This is a bigger issue than many think:

                         alt="Statistics of deaf population">195,697,202 people in the US are deaf.</a>

                         alt="Accessible sites rank higher in search engines.">Accessible sites rank higher in search engines.</a>
   
   Increase user base by at least 20%

## Types of Tools utilized

Screen Readers - These tools transmit text that is displayed on the computer screen to aid a visually impaired user to process. It uses a synthetic voice to tell the user where all the data is on the screen. As a user uses the keyboard to get around on the screen, as they move around the screen, it should read all headings and text on the screen.  If a picture is on the screen, if programmed properly the screen reader will read text displaying for the user what is contained in the picture.

Screen Magnifiers - These tools allow users to amplify the text on the screen in a enlarged screen format usually within a small focused area of the screen. As the mouse is moved around the screen, the objects are magnified so they can be easily read.  As my eyes started changing, my glasses no longer was able to read the screen properly until I got bifocals, screen magnifiers amplify the text and make it easier to read.

Speech Recognition - These tools allow users to convert spoken words into text.  It can include dictation to the point of being able to manipulating applications on the screen using words understood by the software tools.

Alternative Input Devices - These tools allow users with specific needs to be able to manipulate a computer using modified pointing device, eye movement, expanded keyboards, head-operated pointing devices, modified keyboards to specialized software.

## HTML coding for accessibility

1. In URL links provide words to describe what the link is about to the visual impaired, for example:

   ```
   <a alt="One of most well known websites to buy products by auction or buy now at this price" 
     href="http://www.ebay.com">
   ```
   
2. Images should describe the picture using word, for example:

   ```
   <a alt="blue winter landscape with rainbow" href="URL ...
   ```
   
3. Turn on captioning in videos for YouTube or Vimeo, Must have QuickTime Player. <a target="_blank" href="http://etc.usf.edu/techease/4all/web-accessibility/adding-closed-captions-to-youtube-videos/">Click to learn how to transcribe videos.</a> for example:

   ```
   <iframe width="640" height="360" target="_blank" href="URL cc_load_policy=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   ```
   
4. Add label for type="radio", for example:

   ```
   <fieldset>
    <h1>Salutation</h1>

    <label for="salutation_mr">Mr <input id="salutation_mr" 
          name="salutation" type="radio" value="mr"><label>

    <label for="salutation_mrs">Mrs <input id="salutation_mrs" 
          name="salutation" type="radio" value="mrs"><label>

    <label for="salutation_miss">Miss <input id="salutation_miss" 
          name="salutation" type="radio" value="miss"><label>

    <label for="salutation_ms">Ms <input id="salutation_miss" 
          name="salutation" type="radio" value="ms"><label>
    </fieldset>
   ```
5. Emphasis do not use italic as it causes reading issues, better to use es{..}  or  strong{...}

   ```
   strong{
   font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```
   
6. Anytime you use a website, make sure if it should be http:// or https://
7. Anytime you use a website, check to see if there should be a / at the end of the website name
8. Anytime the link your using redirects, it slows down the application, update the link to the correct location periodically.
