This tutorial aims to have you ending up with a serverless app running in 
Microsoft Azure cloud.

It's assumed that you're already familiar with
[the Serverless framework](/serverless/)


## Why #

<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/01/serverless-is-the-new-multitenancy/">
Multitenancy</a>
"not only allowed for higher gross margins, it made it viable to serve small and medium businesses with world-class software  —  at a profit."


## Getting Started #

0. <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">
   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions</a>
   is the home page for Functions.

0. Click the green "Get Started" button.
0. Enter your email address. If this is your first time,
   <strong>Your subscription</strong> appears
   automatically with a suggested name for your new function.

0. PROTIP: Rather than accepting "functions47c313e5" or something else,
   come up with a convention, such as:
   "CXR1-dr-WUS-v01" for West US region.

   PROTIP: Include the region in your Function app name so you are less confused.

0. Select your region, such as "West US" and 
   
0. Click the blue "Create + get started" button, then wait.

   ### Timer Scenarios #

0. Click the <strong>Timer</strong> sample to get started.

   We'll cover the 
   <a href="#DPFunc">Data processing</a> and 
   <a href="#Webhook">Webhook + API</a> later.

0. Click <strong>JavaScript</strong> if you want the possibility for cross-platform code.

   C# only runs on Azure.

0. Click "Create this function".

   If you time-out here you'll return to the 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseRecentResourcesBlade">
   Azure Resources Dashboard</a>.
