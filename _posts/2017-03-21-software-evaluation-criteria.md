   As we all learned during the 2016 presidential election, polls can be very wrong
   because of biases blind-siding pollsters.

   ### LinkedIn mentions

   LinkedIn Search for people mentioning the product keywords in their profile. 

## Editions

   Free unlimited trials

## Ease of setup

   * Dockerized
   * Ansible
   * Puppet
   * Chef

   Ansible makes use of SSH and Python, which are built into Linux operating systems.

## Ease of uninstall

   Transitioning from one tool to another is inevitable.

## Server Configuration automation

   Ansible and Salt configuration files are in YAML format - administrator oriented and thus easy to learn.
   Puppet DSL and Chef Ruby DSL (Domain-Specific Language) require programming skill.
   (steep learning curve)

## Workflow Automation

## Management

## Performance speed

## Scalability of architecture

   Ansible runs with a single active node, called the primary instance. 
   If the primary goes down, a secondary instance takes its place.
   Chef uses the term primary and backup server.
   Puppet and Salt uses the term active master in a multi-master architecture.

   Ansible servers pushes configurations to all nodes, which immediately executes.
   Puppet clients <strong>pulls</strong> configurations from the Server.
   Salstack same.
