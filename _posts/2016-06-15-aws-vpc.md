This tutorial covers the creation of Virtual Private Clouds within AWS two different ways:

1. Manually on the AWS Management Console.
2. <a href="#CF-VPC">Automatically using CloudFormation</a>

We begin with the manual approach to cover PROTIPs and NOTEs in this our tutorial.

   * VPC Naming conventions
   * CIDR blocks.

<hr />

## Create VPCs using Management Console #

This chapter condenses http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html
and adds additional PROTIPs and NOTEs.

0. A pre-requisite for this is my [AWS Basics tutorial](/aws-basics/)

   A default VPC is a pre-requisite for setting up an EC2 server instance.

0. At https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/

0. Select "Your VPC".

0. Click the "Create VPC" blue button.

0. For Name tag, consider a naming convention:

   * "dev", "qa", "prod" since many use isolated VPCs for different enviornments.

   * "public" or "private" network access.

0. For CIDR block, see below.



   VPCs are really software-defined networks (SDN).

For security, some servers can only make outbound calls to the internet (through the <a href="#NAT">NAT server</a>).

   REMEMBER: There is one VPC per Availability Zone.

A single Gateway serves all VPCs because that is the address
the public DNS resolves corporate host names to.




<a href="#CF-VPC"></a>

## Automatically create VPC using CloudFormation #

In the CF JSON to define a VPC, CF automatically populates the
"VpcId" : { "Ref" : "VPC" },

{% highlight text %}
  "Resources" : {
     "VPC" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::VPC",
      "Properties" : {
        "CidrBlock" : "10.0.0.0/16"
      }
    },

    "InternetGateway" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::InternetGateway",
      "Properties" : {
      }
    },

    "AttachGateway" : {
       "Type" : "AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment",
       "Properties" : {
         "VpcId" : { "Ref" : "VPC" },
         "InternetGatewayId" : { "Ref" : "InternetGateway" }
       }
    },
{% endhighlight %}


NOTE: One annoyance of EC2 at the moment is the use of
static IP addresses in configurations.


### CIDR Subnet notation #

<a name="Octets"></a>

An example CIDR subnet looks like this:

   <pre>
   10.0.1.0/18
   </pre>

   A dot separates each of the 4 "octets".
   Each bucket can be from 1 to 253.
   Two of the values cannot be used for nodes because networks use addresses of all 0's nor all 1's for their own broadcasting.

   PROTIP: To avoid conflicts, some organizations use a convention replacing the "1" in the same above with:

   * 1 for app tier zone a, 2 for zone b
   * 51 for ELB zone a, 52 for ELB zone b
   * 11 for databases (RDS), etc.

   PROTIP: Some organizations allocate the bottom half of the 255 possibilities to private and upper half to public addresses:

   * private 10.0.1.0/24 (3rd byte < 129)
   * public 10.0.129.0/24 (3rd byte > 128)

Address ranges for private (non-routed) use (per <a target="_blank" href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1918.txt">RFC 1918</a>):

   * 10.0.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255     within "Class A" addresses 1 -> 126
   * 172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.255.255   within "Class B" addresses 127 -> 191
   * 192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.255 within "Class C" addresses 192 -> 223

   <strong>The CIDR block for a default in VPC is always 172.31.0.0/16.</strong>

PROTIP: Carefully predict how many nodes each subnet might need.
Once assigned, AWS VPC subnet blocks can’t be modified.
If you find an established VPC is too small, you’ll need to terminate all of the instances of the VPC, delete it, and then create a new, larger VPC,
then instantiate again.

<a name="NetmaskNodes"></a>

Refer to this table of nodes for each <strong>netmask</strong> Amazon allows:

   <table border="1">
   <tr><th align="right"> # Nodes </th><th align="center"> Netmask </th><th align="left"> Subnet Mask </th></tr>
   <tr><td align="right">     14 </td><td align="center"> /28 </td><td> 255.255.255.240 </td></tr>
   <tr><td align="right">     30 </td><td align="center"> /27 </td><td> 255.255.255.224 </td></tr>
   <tr><td align="right">     62 </td><td align="center"> /26 </td><td> 255.255.255.192 </td></tr>
   <tr><td align="right">    126 </td><td align="center"> /25 </td><td> 255.255.255.128 </td></tr>
   <tr><td align="right">    254 </td><td align="center"> /24 </td><td> 255.255.255.0   </td></tr>
   <tr><td align="right">    510 </td><td align="center"> /23 </td><td> 255.255.254.0   </td></tr>
   <tr><td align="right"> 65,534 </td><td align="center"> /16 </td><td> 255.255.255.240 </td></tr>
   </table>

   For example, if all you'll need are 14 nodes, specify `/28`.
   Notice that the larger the CIDR netmask, the less hosts in the subnet.

   #### Bucket of Candies Analogy #

   If you must know why, here is my analogy (best for kinesthetic learners):
   When we say a sports star makes a "7 figure salary", we figure out what that means with a table like this:

   | Figure: |         7 |       6 |      5 |     4 |   3 |  2 |  1 |
   | ------- | --------: | ------: | -----: | ----: | --: | -: | -: |
   | Values: | 1,000,000 | 100,000 | 10,000 | 1,000 | 100 | 10 |  1 |

   Now imagine a bucket for each figure level, a different size bucket containing candies of various colors and patterns, unique one for each possible value.
   People earning 7 figures can choose from the bucket holding a million possible values.

   If we add up the values (colors) possible in the right-most 3 buckets,
   we would have 100 + 10 + 1 = 111 possibilities.

   #### Counting in Base 2 #

   Instead of the way banks use to do arithmetic (called "base 10" or decimal calculations),
   where ten $1 bills is equivalent to a 10 dollar bill,
   computers count using "base 2" or binary arithmetic using 0's and 1's.
   So each of their "buckets" have a different number of possibility values:

   | Figure:        |   8 |   7 |   6 |   5 |   4 |   3 |   2 |   1 |
   | -------------- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
   | Values:        | 254 | 128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |   8 |   4 |   2 |
   | Possibilities: | 510 | 254 | 126 |  62 |  30 |  14 |   6 |   2 |

   If we add up the values possibles in the <strong>right-most</strong> 3 buckets,
   we would have 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 possibilities.

   Look back above at <a href="#NetmaskNodes">the table of nodes</a>.
   Again, 14 possibilities.

   The buckets on the <strong>left side</strong> "buckets" are used to identify <strong>subnets</strong> managed by Amazon rather than indiviual nodes.

<a name="VPN"></a>

## VPN #

Configure <strong>Site to Site</strong> VPN to securely transfer data among Amazon VPCs in different regions or between Amazon VPC to your on-premise data center.


## Resources #

* Add Intrusion Prevention or Intrusion Detection virtual appliances to secure protocols and to take preventive/corrective action.

* Configure <strong>Privileged Identity</strong> access management solutions to monitor and audit access by Administrators of your VPC.

* Add anti-virus for cleansing specific EC2 instances inside a VPC. Trend micro offers a product for this.
