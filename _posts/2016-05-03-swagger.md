With apps of enterprise size and complexity,
<strong>manual</strong> coding of the client and server programming code-base by human developers
can be repetitive and error-prone, therefore take more time and are more expensive than they should be.

However, if code is <a href="#SpecMarkup">marked up with comments recognized by the Doxegen parser</a>,
they can be <a href="#SpecGen">organized into a <strong>specification</strong></a>
readable by both humans and computers.

There are several competing API specification formats (such as RAML and WADL),
but <strong>Swagger</strong> seems to be the most popular at this time.
So many have written programs to automate processing of Swagger specs.

The ability of developers to <strong>discover</strong> the API and make use of it quickly
is important toward the objective of getting them to <strong>use your API in their apps</strong>.

Documentation generated about the API helps not only to understand the API efficiently,
but also for the API to be discovered by <strong>public galleries of APIs</strong>.

<strong>Quality scans</strong> of specification coding based on adjustable rules
can not only boost confidence, but also provide a differentiator for community-building.

A <strong>demonstration</strong> app
that enables potential users to understand the experience and value of the services exposed, enough for
developers to invest time examining the Swagger spec
close enough to create <strong>client apps of their own</strong> consuming the API.

Programs are getting more mature at reading Swagger specs to <strong>generate programming code</strong>
in various programming languages.
Being able to generate a demo app from Swagger specs would cut time to market
and encourage reusability of code.

As can a <strong>mock server</strong> for developers to access locally off-line during development
has been shown to shorten development cycles by reducing developers waiting for others to finish.

<strong>Test code</strong> generation is provided by several developers in the open source community.

More sophisticated variation of <strong>data values</strong> in generated code
is now the frontier.
Such data include values and statistics from both historical points in time and projections and predictions of values expected in the future.

This involves the addition of <strong>meta-information</strong> logic of choices into code-generation programs.


## What is Swagger? #

Swagger Core is a **Description Language (DL)** for REST APIs. It provides:

  * a blueprint of layout,
  * a contract,
  * metadata, and
  * human-readable documentation.

The goal of Swagger is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

In other words, Swagger's objective is to be a complete framework for
describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services
for developers to fully program clients calling them.

Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.
This enables <a href="swagger-codegen.md">Swagger CodeGen</a>
to generate client code for different programming languages.

Swagger removes a barrier to enterprise adoption of REST API
by making a larger number of REST APIs governable, shareable, and human-readeable.<a href="#[1]">[1]</a>

<a name="Who"></a>

## Who built Swagger?

Swagger originated from folks at Wordnik.com (the on-line English dictionary)
by Reverb Technologies (helloreverb.com)
which was absorbed by <a target="_blank" href="https://inform.com/company.html/">Inform.com</a>, now
a part of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mongodb.com/customers/reverb-technologies">
MongoDB</a>.
   The old URL <a target="_blank" ref="nofollow" href="http://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki">
   http://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki</a>
   now redirects to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki">
   http://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/smartbear-picks-swagger-api-project/2015/03/26">
On March, 2015</a>,
the testing company SmartBear acquired from Reverb the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.swagger.io/">
swagger.io</a> website
and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.swaggerhub.com/">
SwaggerHub.com</a>
which provides an instance of swagger on a free platform for teams to collaborate on and coordinate across the entire workflow of an API’s lifecycle.
SwaggerHub includes connectors for GitHub, DockerHub, and Ready! API.
The site leverages a centralized definition to enable teams to work together to iteratively design, build, document, and manage an API.


## The spec #

On January 1, 2016, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md">
Swagger Specification at version 2.0</a> was transferred to the Open API Initiative (OAI),
and renamed to the OpenAPI Specification. To avoid confusion, many now refer to the spec as
"Swagger (OpenAPI) 2.0".

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/swagger-api">
https://github.com/swagger-api</a> is the group maintaining

 * swagger-core
 * swagger-spec
 * swagger-ui
 * swagger-codegen

## Spec Gen #

Swagger's focus was originally serving Node.js developers,
but additional langagues now make use of Swagger.

Generating Swagger specs from legacy code can be the most time consuming aspect.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle">
   Swashbuckle</a> scans through C# WebAPI code and generates API website.

* <a href="#Doxygen">
   Doxygen</a> is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C source code.
   format comments in code can be picked up by the scanner.

* Sandcastle

* RDoc for Ruby code

* JavaDocs generates code from comments in Java

## Website Gen #

Several tools generate API documentation in HTML for display on websites:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc">ReDoc</a>
* Microsoft Azure API Management, which charges.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">
   Mashery's IODocs</a> is written to run on Node.js referencing a
   <a target="_blank" href="http://redis.io/download"> Redis</a> key+value storage engine.

* The Enunciate
REST API framework is an open-source Java-based Web API framework.
It creates full HTML documentation of the services it generates, where the documentation is assembled from JavaDocs comments.

<a name="Dependencies"></a>

## Dependencies #

Swagger Core stores JAX-RS API designs in JSON files from which
Swagger UI dynamically generates beautiful HTML documentation.

Swagger makes use of Jackson,
the multi-purpose Java library for processing JSON data format.

<a target="_blank" href="http://swagger.io/swagger-core/">
Swagger-core</a> explains the use of maven build.

### Sample endpoint #

<a name="Format"></a>

## Format #

The standard Swagger spec doesn’t support some features.
So vendor

   * Request body examples (mock server is generating them from Schema)

   * Example values of HTTP headers

   * Multiple requests
