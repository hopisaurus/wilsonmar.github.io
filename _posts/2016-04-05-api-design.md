The less coupling, the better to evolve.

## Domains and Context

## Integrations #

SMS, emails can be sent via the API from Twilio.com.
An investor in Twilio, Byron Deeter <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/31/api-economy/">said</a>:
"APIs provide the "digital glue" that empowers developers to create new software applications,
partnerships, and even new businesses. The <strong>business-to-developer</strong> market is quickly becoming one
of the fastest growing opportunities within cloud computing."

A high-quality API:

* provides high-value data and functionality that meets real needs or unlocks compelling opportunities;

* has a low integration cost because client integration is facilitated by a lucid, consistent API design, great documentation, interactive tooling, and client SDKs, all wrapped into a smooth, developer-friendly onboarding experience;

* has low operational and support overhead because it’s thoroughly tested in all aspects, and instrumented for reliability; and

* generates business value because it’s highly adopted by client developers, for all of the above reasons.

## Domain-Driven Design

<a target="_blank" href="https://domainlanguage.com/ddd/">
domain-driven-design</a> 
of API modeling provides a framework for interoperability:

* Identify a bounded context where we plan to provide a family of highly interoperable services. 
   
   This could be a microservices architecture; an enterprise, or an entire industry.

* Formalize key concepts and relationships as a domain model. 

   This should be natural to users, and may borrow familiar terminology and data structures from other systems well-known in that context.

* Align data representations, code, product documentation, and team communication to the domain model, forming a ubiquitous language.
