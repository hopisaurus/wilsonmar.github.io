{% include _toc.html %}

Here are my notes toward building an "unsupervised" machine-learning framework 
to identify patterns in various logs.

Logs are produced by each program components:

   * <a href="#OSLogs">Operating system logs</a>
   * <a href="#WebSvrLogs">Web Server logs</a>
   * Perfmon
   * <a href="#AppLogs">Custom application logs</a> to commemorate specific events 
   such as an invoice being sent or other business transaction being processed.

https://sematext.github.io/logagent-js/parser/
detects log formats based on a pattern library (yaml file) and converts it to a JSON Object:


## Visualizations 

The value to keeping logs is to provide <strong>insights</strong> to what is being logged.

That is usually about the pattern and anomalies of occurances <strong>over time</strong>.

SIEM systems collect and analyze logs over time to detect persistent threats.

## System logs

Microsoft System Logs can be parsed using

<a name="WebSvrLogs"></a>

## Web server logs

Web servers such as Apache, IIS, NGINX, etc. store an entry for each HTTP and file (resource) query.

Apache and others create logs in a W3C-defined format.

A trivial sample is provided at data/apache.access.log.

A fuller example is provided at 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.monitorware.com/en/logsamples/apache.php">
http://www.monitorware.com/en/logsamples/apache.php</a>

A parser and model for the log file: See ApacheAccessLog.java.

See https://databricks.gitbooks.io/databricks-spark-reference-applications/content/logs_analyzer/chapter1/spark.html

A configuration file specifies what fields are output in the log.

### MS Log Parser for SQL

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24659">
Microsoft Log Parser</a>
provides SQL-like query access to text-based data such as log files, XML files and CSV files, as well as key data sources on the Windows® operating system such as the Event Log, the Registry, the file system, and Active Directory®. It was created for Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional Edition.

$31 http://lizard-labs.com/log_parser_lizard.aspx provides a GUI to it.

QUESTION: Its equivalent for Linux?


## Perfmon logs

MS PAL (Performance Analysis of Logs)

https://pal.codeplex.com/

It makes use of PowerShell v2.0 or greater
which uses 
Microsoft Chart Controls for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1

## Custom application logs

Code to output logs

https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=90134fb0f1c148a48c65319287dde2f7


## Log gathering

Due to their size, systems "rotate" logs, meaning new file names are created when the 
allocated disk space for each file is used.
