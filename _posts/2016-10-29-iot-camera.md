https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-picamera/
Get started with the Raspberry Pi camera module, using Python and picamera. 
You'll take still pictures, record video, and apply image effects.


## USB cameras

USB cameras have the advantage of a <strong>longer chord</strong>
 to separate the camera from the Pi case.

USB cameras manufacturered for PCs are a good entry camera
because they can be obtained cheaply in swapmeets, GoodWill, and other second-hand stores.

They are lower resolution.

## CSI camera

<a target="_blank" href="http://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface">
http://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface</a>
provides software to use cameras connected to the Raspberry Pi board
via it CSI interface.
It does not work with USB cameras.

When a camera recognizes movement, it can trigger recording.

PIR (Passive IfraRed)
