## Starter Kits #

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-JK29LP-Trojan-Dash-Button/dp/B01C3JBA7M/">
<img align="right" alt="aws-iot trojan button 20180810-168x196-i11.png" width="168" height="196" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17570835/3a85c744-5f0b-11e6-99fa-60aaf46ea549.jpg"></a>
Got my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C7WE5WM">
AWS IoT device</a> today (August 3, 2016). 
$20 each is a steep price compared with Dash buttons also from Amazon.
Buy a Dash Button for $4.99 and receive a $4.99 credit after your first press.
(Hold on while we wait for it to arrive)

Compare vs. the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/internet-button">
$49 "Internet Button"</a>
from Particle.io which has 
4 tactile (directional) buttons,
11 individually controllable RGB LEDs, and a
ADXL362 3-axis accelerometer.
All without any wires or soldering.

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/getting-started/#kits">
Other starter kits</a> include the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel%C2%AE-Edison-Grove-Starter-Powered/dp/B0168KU5FK?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0">

from Seed</a> with sensors for indoor environments.


## Getting Started #

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/getting-started">
https://aws.amazon.com/iot/getting-started/<br />
provides a list of URLs related to IoT.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/images/aws-iot/Internet-Of-Things_AWSIoT.svg">
0. The AWS IoT service is its own category among all AWS services:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot">
   https://aws.amazon.com/iot</a>

0. Login to Amazon's own IoT Resources Console at <br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home</a>

0. Select a location. Initially "N. Virginia" was the only region supporting Lambda.

   * Jul 25, 2016, Asia Pacific (Singapore)
   * Jun 23, 2016, Sydney in  Asia Pacific 
   * US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

   ### AWS Lambda Function #

0. When you click "Connect AWS IoT Button", you'll be sent to the AWS Lambda console.
   Specifically, this URL:
   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/configure-triggers?bp=iot-button-email">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/create/configure-triggers?bp=iot-button-email</a>

   The "configure-triggers?bp=iot-button-email" in the URL is 
   equivalent to going to the AWS Lambda console at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home</a>,
   click "Create a Lambda function", 
   click "Select blueprint", 
   then find and select "iot-button-email".
   Its description is "An AWS Lambda function that sends an email on the click of an IoT button.""

0. For IoT Type, select "IoT Button" (model JK76PL),

0. Type in Device Serial Number (DSN) 
   <strong>without spaces</strong> from the back of the device.

   PROTIP: From Permission definitions for templates detailed 
   <a target="_blan" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/policy-templates.html">
   here</a>, the AWS IoT Button permissions" are:

   <pre>
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sns:ListSubscriptionsByTopic",
                "sns:CreateTopic",
                "sns:SetTopicAttributes",
                "sns:Subscribe",
                "sns:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
   </pre>

0. Click Next.

   ### Test #

0. Return to this screen by logging into:<br />
   <amp-img width="650" height="133" alt="aws-iot lambda button 20160807-650x133.png" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/17464187/56a2699e-5c8d-11e6-8da6-6807be3ed714.jpg"></amp-img>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/AWS-iot-button?tab=code">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/AWS-iot-button?tab=code</a>

0. Pressing the blue link to the right of "AWS IoT:" for the Resources screen:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/thing/">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/thing/iotbutton_...</a>

   ### Generate certificate and policy for Node #

0. If the black part of the screen isn't visible, click the "?" to expand it.

0. Click <strong>Connect a device</strong>.
0. Check "NodeJS". The text on screen:

   First, you will need to create and download security credentials for your device. The following steps will help you to create and download security credentials (a certificate for authentication, and a policy that defines what the device using this certificate is allowed to do).

   You can generate a certificate with 1-click. When you generate a certificate, we will also generate a default security policy named iotbutton_G030......N0AV-Policy. You can modify this security policy at any time through the 'Resources' panel of this console.

0. Click "Generate certificate and policy".
0. Click "Download public key to your Downloads folder.
0. Click "Download private key"
0. Click "Download certificate"
0. Click "Confirm &amp; start connecting".

   An example:

   <pre>
{
  "host": "a1ysu30jyr2f8t.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  "port": 8883,
  "clientId": "iotbutton_G030....1N0AV",
  "thingName": "iotbutton_G030.....1N0AV",
  "caCert": "root-CA.crt",
  "clientCert": "427c7ac25f-certificate.pem.crt",
  "privateKey": "427c7ac25f-private.pem.key"
}
   </pre>

   NOTE the file prefix "427c7ac25f" will be different every time keys are generated.

0. Highlight the text on the screen and copy it. 

0. PROTIP: You do not need to Click to Download the AWS IoT Node.js SDK (file <strong>aws-iot-device-sdk-js-latest.zip</strong>) at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/blob/master/README.md">
   https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js</a><br />
   because most developers obtain the SDK by using the Node Package Manager
   which detects and updates versions:

   <tt><strong>
   npm install aws-iot-device-sdk
   </strong></tt>

   This contains a gulpfile.js and a package.json file for implementation by NPM.
   That means the Gulp app needs to be installed as well.

0. When you return to the Thing menu,
   notice that each certificate key appears above the hand icon.

## Shadows #

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/images/aws-iot/Internet-Of-Things_AWSIoT_shadow.svg"><br />
Each device is registered in a 
Device Registry.
Each device is represented as a Device <strong>Shadow</strong> (like an avatar)
with attributes within the Registry.

The two standards bodies in IoT are the Thread Group
(formed by ARM, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Google Nest)
and OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation), 
formerly the OIC (Open Interconnect Consortium) and 
the Microsoft-backed AllSeen Alliance.

Microsoft earlier released its open-source IoTivity bridge 
to connect OIC tools
with the AllSeen Alliance's AllJoyn APIs to talk to OIC-compatible IoT devices.


## Protocols #

One distinguishing character of each device is the networking protocol it uses.
