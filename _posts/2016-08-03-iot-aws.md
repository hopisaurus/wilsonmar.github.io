This article contains my notes about hooking up sensors to 
Amazon's IoT (Internet of Things) cloud services.
This makes use of AWS "real" and fun, especially for kinesthetic learners.

{% include _intro.html %}



## Lowest cost IoT #

Amazon provides perhaps the lowest-cost IoT device: a
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C7WE5WM">
$19.95</a>
<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/button/">
Limited Release Programmable AWS IoT Button</a>.
Mine came August 3, 2016.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-JK29LP-Trojan-Dash-Button/dp/B01C3JBA7M/">
<img align="right" alt="aws-iot trojan button 20180810-168x196-i11.png" width="168" height="196" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17570835/3a85c744-5f0b-11e6-99fa-60aaf46ea549.jpg"></a>
Its price is actually steep compared with 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-JK29LP-Trojan-Dash-Button/dp/B01C3JBA7M/">
brand-name Dash buttons from Amazon</a>.
They're free (for Prime members) in that after you buy one for $4.99, 
you receive a credit with your first purchase with it.
(Hold on while waiting for it to arrive)

NOTE: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXM2HCXYRI">
this guy</a> brags he re-purposed the Dash by intercepting its ARP request, but doesn't show how.
The device uses port 8443.
   <a target="_blank" href="http://portquiz.net:8443/">
   Click here to test if it's open on your network</a>.

BTW, Amazon also has a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Dash-quick-easy-shop/dp/B00GMSIHOU/">
$50 wand</a> to scan barcodes
and listen to you begging for stuff.
An Apple/Android phone is needed to activate the device. 


## Other buttons #


If you want additional capability in a button,
look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/internet-button">
$49 "Internet Button" from Particle.io</a>. 
It uses the same <a target="_blank" href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless-connectivity/wireless-lan/bcm943362wcd4">
Broadcom</a> 802.11b/g/n wi-fi chip as in Amazon Dash, Nest Protect, and LIFX.
It has 4 tactile (directional) buttons to issue outbound events, 
and receives inputs to control 11 RGB LEDs, plus a
ADXL362 3-axis accelerometer.
All without any wires or soldering.

<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/kwik-raises-3-million-to-take-on-amazon-dash-buttons/">
Kwik is also making buttons</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="https://flic.io/">flic.io</a>
offers four buttons for $99 ($25 each). It may be worth it:
They are powered by <strong>repleaceable watch batteries</strong>,
and connect via Bluetooth to their <a target="_blank" href="https://start.flic.io/">
mobile apps</a> (from Shortcut Labs AB). So no nerdy setup like AWS requires.
Their buttons also have a removeable sticky film that's removeable for cleaning.
However, this puts the buttons within a closed ecosystem.
To choose an action, Click, Double click, and Hold.
(Too bad it doesn't act like a locator beacon as well)


## Range #

QUIZ: Which type of transmission has further range? Bluetooth or WiF?

The standard range of "class 1" Bluetooth devices (transmitting at 100mW)
is about 100 meters or <strong>328 feet</strong>, 
which is comparable to that of an 802.11b WLAN device. 

A typical wireless router in an indoor point-to-multipoint arrangement using 802.11n 
and a stock antenna might have a range of <strong>32 metres (105 ft)</strong>.


## Battery life? #

As with any electronics, the hassle factor and limitation is the battery.

WARNING: Amazon's Dash button uses <strong>wi-fi</strong> (2.4 Ghz) so its battery may not last as long as
other buttons using Bluetooth Low Energy data transmission.

PROTIP: Battery status (remaining voltage) is sent to Amazon every time you press the button.
When the device battery runs out of charge, there is no way to recharge or replace the battery.
The battery is rated to last for 1,000 presses. That's over 2 years if you press it once a day.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMiplPiU2nI&t=1m26s">
This teardown</a> found Dash buttons contain an Energizer brand AAA Lithium battery.

The brains of the Dash button is a 32-bit, 120MHz 64-pin ARM Cortex M3 microprocessor
from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/CD00225773.pdf">
ST Microelectronics (STM32F205RG6)</a>,
containing 128 KB of RAM, 1 MB of flash memory, and 16 MB of 
<a target="_blank" href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/25044A.pdf">
SPI flash</a>.


## Single-button tricks #

* This bathroom needs attention!

   PROTIP: The trouble with any re-programmable unit is there is incentive for it to be stolen.
   But (at $5) is the worth the $500 it take to put it behind a wall?

* Honey I'm home! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackster.io/reanimationxp/amazon-re-invent-dash-button-aws-ifttt-infinibutton-daaf5d?ref=part&ref_id=13747&offset=0">
   Send a signal</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://ifttt.com/maker">IFTTT.com's Maker Channel</a>,
   though which you can specify all manner of actions (send voicemail, SMS text, Skype, etc.).
   <a href="#IFTTT">Setup instructions below</a>.

* Track task (chore) completion time so if it's not done <strong>a reminder can be sent out</strong> via 
   Slack, Facebook, Twilio, or an internal company's application.

* I fell down and can't get up! The Amazon button has a loop so it can be warn at the end of a lanyard.

* Voting machine (what's for lunch?)
* Start the coffee maker from your bedstand

* Switch a smart light bulb on and off (party mode). 

   The Philips Hue light requires a hub.<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lifx.com/">LIFX</a> bulbs do not.

* Mute TV without the delay of figuring which of 20 buttons to press on the remote
* Remote control home appliances
* Remote control Netflix
* Order your favorite pizza for delivery

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackster.io/iotians/uber-cab-booking-3f8f30?ref=part&ref_id=13747&offset=11">
   Hail a Uber car</a>

### Additional things #

PROTIP: Once you get the Button working with one third-party API,
you can add context from additional sensors and use other APIs.

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/getting-started/#kits">
Other device starter kits</a> specifically for AWS include the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel%C2%AE-Edison-Grove-Starter-Powered/dp/B0168KU5FK?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0">

## Why Amazon IoT? #

   <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="/images/aws-iot/Internet-Of-Things_AWSIoT.svg">
   The AWS IoT service is its own category among all AWS services:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot">
   https://aws.amazon.com/iot</a>

The real power of using Amazon's IoT is that it enables you to integrate with 
the most popular cloud services for enterprises and others:

* <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">
   AWS Lambda</a>
   runs your code on virtual servers from Amazon EC2 in response to events.

* <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">
   Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>
   provides scalable storage in the AWS cloud. For more information, see Amazon S3.

* <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank">
   Amazon DynamoDB</a>
   provides managed NoSQL databases.

* <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" target="_blank">
   Amazon Kinesis</a>
   enables real-time processing of streaming data at a massive scale. 

* <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/" target="_blank">
   Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a>
   sends or receives notifications.

* <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">
   Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a>
   stores data in a queue to be retrieved by applications.

More importantly, its early start and popularity means AWS has become the most mature
of clouds, with the most experienced people who have learned how to work with it.


## How it all works #

Getting the AWS IoT Button working is not really easy largely because of setting up adequate security.

<a target="_blank" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html">
This</a> provides a description of components described in the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/iot/quickstart">
Quickstart tutorial</a><br />
lists <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/how-it-works/">
system components</a>:

<a target="_blank" title="awsiot-how-it-works_howitworks_1-26.png" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17651526/5936d7be-6226-11e6-8338-450f68097d7a.png">
<img alt="awsiot-how-it-works_howitworks_1-26-650x381-i11.jpg" width="650" height="381" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17651552/d195a654-6226-11e6-9650-f54baf414f72.jpg"></a>

* <strong>Device gateway</strong>
   enables devices to securely and efficiently communicate with AWS IoT.

* <strong>Security and Identity service</strong>
   provides shared responsibility for security in the AWS cloud. Your things must keep their credentials safe in order to send data securely to the message broker. The message broker and rules engine use AWS security features to send data securely to devices or other AWS services.

* <strong>Message broker</strong>
   provides a secure mechanism for things and AWS IoT applications to publish and receive messages from each other. You can use either the MQTT protocol directly or MQTT over WebSockets to publish and subscribe. You can use the HTTP REST interface to publish.

* <strong>Rules engine</strong>
   provides message processing and integration with other AWS services. You can use a SQL-based language to select data from message payloads, process the data, and send the data to other services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda. You can also use the message broker to republish messages to other subscribers.

* <strong>Thing registry</strong>
   is Sometimes referred to as the Device Registry. Organizes the resources associated with each thing. You register your things and associate up to three custom attributes with each thing. You can also associate certificates and MQTT client IDs with each thing to improve your ability to manage and troubleshoot your things.

* <strong>Thing Shadows service</strong>
   provides persistent representations of your things in the AWS cloud. You can publish updated state information to a thing shadow, and your thing can synchronize its state when it connects. Your things can also publish their current state to a thing shadow for use by applications or devices.

* <strong>Thing shadow</strong>
   is sometimes referred to as a device shadow. A JSON document used to store and retrieve current state information for a thing (device, app, and so on).

## Configure the thing #

   <amp-img width="650" height="356" alt="aws-iot-setup-flow-v01-650x356-i11.jpg" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17655587/3e765764-626d-11e6-8edc-0588d2e35e46.jpg"></amp-img>

0. PROTIP: Know the password to your network's WiFi because Button setup needs it.


   ### Generate certificates #

0. Login to Amazon's own IoT Resources Console at <br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home/">
   <strong>https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home</strong></a>

   <a name="Region"></a>

0. Select a location (region) from the upper right corner.
   Initially "N. Virginia" was the only region supporting Lambda.
   There is now:
   * US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
   * Jun 23, 2016, Sydney in  Asia Pacific 
   * Jul 25, 2016, Asia Pacific (Singapore)
   <br /><br />

0. Click "Create a resource" for the create panel.

   <amp-img alt="aws-iot-resources 20160804-650x80-i14.jpg" width="650" height="80" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17656207/5cddb9c0-6274-11e6-9485-95122914ac0f.jpg"></amp-img>

0. Click "Create a thing".
0. Specify a name such as "AWS-iot-button-01".

   PROTIP: Zero-pad numbers because you'll want more than one ;)

0. Click "Create" button for the black panel to open at the right.

   If the black part of the screen isn't visible, click the "?" on the right edge to expand it.

0. Click "Connect a device".
0. Check "NodeJS". The text on screen:

   First, you will need to create and download security credentials for your device. The following steps will help you to create and download security credentials (a certificate for authentication, and a policy that defines what the device using this certificate is allowed to do).

   You can generate a certificate with 1-click. When you generate a certificate, we will also generate a default security policy named iotbutton_G030......N0AV-Policy. You can modify this security policy at any time through the 'Resources' panel of this console.

0. Click "Generate certificate and policy".
0. Click "Download public key" to your Downloads folder.
0. Click "Download private key"
0. Click "Download certificate"
0. Click "Confirm &amp; start connecting".

   <a name="EndpointSubdomain"></a>

   An example:

   <pre>
{
  "host": "ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  "port": 8883,
  "clientId": "iotbutton_G030....1N0AV",
  "thingName": "iotbutton_G030.....1N0AV",
  "caCert": "root-CA.crt",
  "clientCert": "427c7ac25f-certificate.pem.crt",
  "privateKey": "427c7ac25f-private.pem.key"
}
   </pre>

   NOTE: The first part of the host string (such as "ABCDEFG1234567") is known as the <strong>Enpoint Subdomian</strong>.

   NOTE: Certifiate file prefix "427c7ac25f" will be different every time keys are generated.

0. Highlight the text on the screen and copy it. 

0. When you return to the Thing menu,
   notice that each certificate key appears above the hand icon.

   ### Resources page #

   Pressing the blue link to the right of "AWS IoT:" for the Resources screen:<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/thing/">
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-east-1#/thing/iotbutton_...</a>
   <amp-img width="650" height="262" alt="aws-iot things certs 20160811-650x262-i12.jpg" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17599908/80361e52-5fbe-11e6-938c-fac589f6d563.jpg"></amp-img>




   PROTIP: You do not need to Click to Download the AWS IoT Node.js SDK
   (file <strong>aws-iot-device-sdk-js-latest.zip</strong>) at<br />
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/blob/master/README.md">
   https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js</a><br />
   because most developers obtain the SDK by using the Node Package Manager
   which detects and updates versions:

   <tt><strong>
   npm install aws-iot-device-sdk
   </strong></tt>

   This contains a gulpfile.js and a package.json file for implementation by NPM.
   That means the Gulp app needs to be installed as well.


   ### Configure Button #

   <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/configure-iot.html">
   Configure the AWS IoT Button</a> to use your Wi-Fi and these resources to connect to AWS securely:

0. To place the button into <strong>configuration mode</strong>, 
   press and hold the button down for 5 seconds until it 
   <a href="#LightColor">flashes blue</a>.

   This activates a small <strong>web server</strong> in the button.

   PROTIP: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMiplPiU2nI&t=5m20s">
   One teardown video</a> found inside a Dash button a
   digital microphone (24-bit 12S 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/obsolete-data-sheets/ADMP441.pdf"> Analog Devices ADMP441</a>) used for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blog.jay-greco.com/wp/?p=116">
   ultrasonic data transmisson during setup</a>.
   So do setup in a quiet place (away from music, fans, transformers in fishtanks, etc.).

0. Navigate to your computer's Network settings page, Open Network Preferences, 

   On a Mac, click the network icon on the top menu of icons.
   to the button's Wi-Fi network SSID shown, such as:

   <strong>Button ConfigureMe - 977</strong>

0. Configure your computer's Network settings 
   to the button's Wi-Fi network SSID shown.

0. Enter your local network's Wi-Fi SSID and password.

0. Click "Browse" next to Certificate and select the <strong>...-certificate.pem.crt</strong> file you just downloaded above.
0. Click "Browse" next to Private Key and select the <strong>...-private.pem.key</strong> file you just downloaded above.

0. Copy the <strong>Endpoint Subdomain</strong>  <a href="#EndpointSubdomain">from before</a>.

0. Copy the <strong>Endpoint Region</strong> from <a href="#Region">region selected before</a>.

0. Check the box to agree to the terms and conditions.
   This should result in an endpoint generated, such as:

   <tt>ABCDEFG1234567.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</tt>

0. PROTIP: Copy the end-point generated for your device, such as:

   Save it in a text file along with the certificates.

0. Click "configure" (tiny button).


   ### WiFi Router #

0. This isn't mentioned on the Amazon page:
   Ignore it if get see a router page (such as "Dlink", etc.) such as:

   http://192.168.0.1/Status/Device_Info.shtml

0. Make sure you can connect to an external webpage from your browser.

   ### Manual Test cases #

When you click the AWS Dash IoT button, it sends a signal through your wi-fi,
over the public internet, and into the AWS cloud.

   The AWS Dash IoT device recognizes 3 click types:

   * SINGLE
   * DOUBLE (press the button twice in quick succession)
   * A LONG clickType is when the first press lasts longer than <strong>1.5 seconds</strong>. 
   <br /><br />

0. Click the button once.

0. Click the button twice quickly.

0. Hold down the button.

   | Blinking pattern | Error |
   | ---------------- | ----- |
   | Short short short | There was an error connecting to the configured wireless network. |
   | Short short long | There was an error obtaining an IP address from the network. |
   | Short long short | There was an error performing the host name lookup. This can be the result of not being able to reach the DNS server or an incorrectly configured AWS IoT endpoint subdomain. |
   | Short long long | Cannot connect to AWS IoT. This can be an issue with the network, but is most likely not an issue with the certificates.|
   | Long short short | Cannot establish a secure connection with the server. This error is most likely due to an unknown or inactive certificate. |
   | Long short long | Received HTTP 403 Forbidden This error is most likely returned because the certificate does not have permission to publish to that topic.|
   | Long long short | There is a problem sending to or receiving from AWS IoT. This is most likely just a networking error.|
   | Long long long | Received an unknown HTTP response from AWS IoT. |

Each device is registered in a 
Device Registry.
Each device is represented as a Device <strong>Shadow</strong> (like an avatar)
with attributes within the Registry.

The two standards bodies in IoT are the Thread Group
(formed by ARM, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Google Nest)
and OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation), 
formerly the OIC (Open Interconnect Consortium) and 
the Microsoft-backed AllSeen Alliance.

Microsoft earlier released its open-source IoTivity bridge 
to connect OIC tools
with the AllSeen Alliance's AllJoyn APIs to talk to OIC-compatible IoT devices.


## Protocols #

One distinguishing character of each device is the networking protocol it uses.
