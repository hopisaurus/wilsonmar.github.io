- [X] Ease of debugging (clear error messages?)
- [X] Complexity to customize

Zeroturnaround.com</a> says:

"Play is super simple to get started. The origination story of the framework essentially boils down to Java developers being envious of Ruby on Rails developers having a super fast prototyping framework. Play has a binary component similar to the Rails component of RoR, which is used for scaffolding and makes Play a little unconventional as a Java web framework. The Getting Started section of the Play framework documentation is a great basic tutorial and thereâ€™s a very low barrier to entry for developers to become at least moderately productive."
