<a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-Play-Framework-or-Spring-MVC-How-should-I-decide-what-to-use
">
Here's</a> Play's rating as a framework vs. Spring, Grails, etc.:

- [X] Fees (open source)
- [X] Speed to first app (samples, documentation)
- [X] Ease of debugging (clear error messages?)
- [X] Complexity to customize
- [X] Scalability
- [X] Community welcoming and helpful?


* Its use of Scala means non-blocking I/O.
* Its use of Functional Programming, immutable objects

## Install stand-alone #

0. JDK 8 is a pre-requisite.

   ### Stand-alone install #

   https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Installing
   shows installing Play through Lightbend Activator,
   described as "sbt plus templates".

   ### Stand-alone install #
   
0. Download the Play standalone installer from<br/>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.playframework.com/download#older-versions">
   <strong>https://www.playframework.com/download#older-versions</strong></a>

0. Select the version your app was built on.
   In this example, play-2.2.2 is used.
   Not the latest version.

0. Unzip.

0. PROTIP: Move the expanded folder to a location where you have both read and write access. 

   (Running play writes some files to directories within the archive, so don’t install to /opt, /usr/local or anywhere else you’d need special permission to write to.)

   The default location for Play is in /opt/, with a version/release code in the folder name.
   <pre>
   /opt/play-2.2.2
   </pre>

   The recommended location is without your user folder :

0. Open the file that OSX invokes for every new Terminal shell window in your favorite text editor,
   such as:
   
   <tt><strong>
   atom ~/.bash_profile
   </strong></tt>

0. Add a path:

   PROTIP: Define the <strong>PLAY2_HOME</strong> environment variable with the path to the Play framework executable.

   This would enable a script to change version without disrupting the setup.

   <pre><strong>
   export PATH=$PATH:~/play-2.2.2
   export PLAY2_HOME=~/play-2.2.2
   </strong></pre>

0. Close the Terminal 
0. In a new Terminal shell session:

   <pre><strong>
   cd ~/play-2.2.2
   chmod a+x play
   chmod a+x framework/build
   </strong></pre>


   ### Verify Play #

0. See if you can play:

   <tt><strong>
   play help
   </strong></tt>

   The response:

   <pre>

## Using Play in an app #

0. Include Play in your app's Maven install pom.xml file.

0. Run `mvn install` in the app's folder to apply the app's Maven pom.xml file.

   Here's an example of the output from the gulpfile:

## History #

<a target="_blank" href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/the-curious-coders-java-web-frameworks-comparison-spring-mvc-grails-vaadin-gwt-wicket-play-struts-and-jsf/2/#!/">
Zeroturnaround.com</a> says:

"The origination story of the framework essentially boils down to Java developers being envious of Ruby on Rails developers having a super fast prototyping framework. Play has a binary component similar to the Rails component of RoR, which is used for scaffolding and makes Play a little unconventional as a Java web framework."

LinkedIn's move to Play in 2013, by Yevgeniy Birkman:

   <amp-youtube data-videoid="8z3h4Uv9YbE" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270"></amp-youtube>
   "Java devs had to spend a quarter of their time waiting for deploy"
