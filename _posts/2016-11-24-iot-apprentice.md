## Build products, not toys and games

The unique aspect of our curriculum is that you
create complete <strong>products consumers buy</strong>
to plug in and simply work.

Rather than starting by messing with breadboards and 
loose wires making little lights flash on the board, 
we focus on <strong>useful</strong> things that
connect to <strong>enterprise clouds</strong>.

Our focus is not for you to build toys for yourself,
but devices that help companies save and make money.


## Start from examples, not blank stares

We begin by NOT training people to program code from scratch.

We begin with by <strong>running</strong> pre-programmed
automation scripts that perform the steps,
and participants learn by making changes to 
see the impact and troubleshoot.

This is much like what happens on real jobs,
which is the purpose of this curriculum.

NOTE: Even though all manual steps are specified in training materials, 
participants experienced with Linux commands and programming experience will 
have an easier time than those who do not.


## Hands-on step-by-step training

Curriculum materials include a hands-on 
<strong>step-by-step tutorial book</strong>
and videos.

This is how we instill habits for good safety and vigilent security
necessary at today's enterprises.



## Reliable products, not elegant code

Testing for reliability and adequate performance
is emphasized here over tricky algorithms not used.

Programming of Python code, shell scripts, and 
JavaScript with Node is learned by examining examples
and discussion about <strong>automated code checking rules</strong>.
This is how professional programmers work.

Quality assurance is an integral part of the curriculum,
to ensure that everything just works for the consumer.

## Customer training and service

A key differentiator with our school is that students are trained 
to explain to customers in plain language
how to use products constructed.

We also ensure that our graduates apply the latest techniques for
excellent customer service and fast turnaround.
That includes training in effective use of social media.
