This article contains my notes about installing and using the
<a target="_blank" href="https://moodle.com/">Moodle</a> 
open-source cloud and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moodle.moodlemobile">
mobile app</a>
to design and present learning.

The open-source app is created at 
Moodle HQ from the wilds of Perth, Australia.

<a target="_blank" href="https://moodle.org/">
moodle.org</a> 
is a helpful community of others using the software.

<a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.moodle.learn/">
Learn Moodle</a>
is a twice-yearly MOOC
