HTTP/SPDY takes longer with large objects transmitted over lines with loss.

ALPH protocol: h2

ALPN, or Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation, is a TLS extension that includes the protocol negotiation within the exchange of hello messages. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301
ALPN negotiates which protocol should be handled over a secure connection in a way that is more efficient and avoids additional round trips. Thus, HTTP:// can be specified and the connection will still be encrypted as if you entered "https://".

Whoever uses 12.53 for HTTP2 need to confirm that

1) http://caniuse.com/#feat=http2 says no support in IE until IE11, which has partial support and only in Windows 10.

2) TLS certificates (not SSL certificates) used on servers

3) confirm whether HTTP2 ALPN is actually activated on in the web server under test.

Most of the performance from SPDY comes from the single TCP connection.
