This page describes the various ways to 
<a href="#LocalInstall">install</a> 
and use a sample Java application for learning Java Spring and 
exploring JVM tools.

GraniteDS provides server and client libraries that can be used to connect desktop and mobile applications to a server using the AMF3 or JMF serialization protocols, through RPC (remoting) and different messaging technologies (Comet, WebSocket, UDP).

version 4.6

The update time graph for
https://github.com/graniteds/graniteds
Granite Data Services
shows scant activity.

This may be that Adobe Flex is not a choice for new development due to advances in native HTML5 WebSockets.

The graniteds.org website (hosting JIRA) is down and
the granitedataservices.com domain (which had been offering support) is now for sale.
