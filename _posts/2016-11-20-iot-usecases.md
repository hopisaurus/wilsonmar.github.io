There are several end-uses for a computer that are <strong>constantly on</strong>:

* Run a local Gitlab server to mirror repositories on your laptop so all changes are 
   immediately replicated on the Pi in case your laptop dies suddenly.

* Display your email so you can just glance at it (at a security risk).
* Display web pages that refreshes itself automatically (web cams).
* Display metrics on a dashboard web page such as a Kibana or Grafana.
* Play a movie (mp4 file) loop using a built-in utility.
* Display feeds from a close-circuit USB Camera.

* Run a NAS server (local Network Attached Storage) off a USB hard drive.
* Run a local Hadoop cluster database.

* Run an <strong>IoT Gateway server</strong> for home automation.
