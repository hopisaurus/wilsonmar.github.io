{% include _toc.html %}

Jenkins is open-source Java software (running under a Tomcat web server)
to invoke jobs 
for building software and conducting tests, etc.

Jenkins can be invoked on a schedule or "continuously" invoked when a trigger is fired
as part of a chain of tasks that kicks off each step in sequence based on ending status.
Thus, Jenkins is a key component of <strong>continuous integration</strong> 
to invoke a chain of tasks needed to ensure that components already unit-tested can be integrated together.

## Alternatives to Jenkins #

<amp-img width="530" height="246" alt="jenkins alternatives" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/12533728/df265ae4-c1ee-11e5-9a0b-bbc380a2d20f.png"></amp-img>

   * Hudson Oracle
   * Bamboo from Atlassian
   * Travis
   * Fabric
   * Capistrano
   * TFS from Microsoft
   * Team City
   * CodeShip
   * Wercker (pronounced like worker)

Jenkins began in 2010 as a fork of Oracle Hudson into Github from java.net 
after its acquisition by Oracle's purchase of Sun.

### Windows Installation #

0. Open a Command Window.
0. Install the Chocolatey package manager (if you haven't already) by copying and pasting the PowerShell command from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey.org</a>
0. Install the version of Jenkins that Chocolatey makes available:
 
   <pre><strong>
   choco install jenkins
   </strong></pre>
 
   If Java is not installed on your computer already, it will be installed as a dependency.

<a id="Verify_install"></a>

## Verify Installation #

0. Verify intallation on a Mac or Linux:

   ```
   which jenkins
   ```
 
   The response is the location Jenkins was installed:
 
   ```
   /usr/local/bin/jenkins
   ```

<a id="Start-server"></a>

## Start server with defaults #

The command to start Jenkins has several parameters.

0. See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins
   for a full explanation, inclidiong use of <strong>nohup</strong>.

0. Start Jenkins using defaults:

   ```
   jenkins
   ```

   If all goes well, you should see:

   ```
   INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running.
   ```

0. Confirm tcp ports Jenkins uses as java (8005 sharing, 8009, 8080):

   ```
   netstat | grep java
   ```

   NOTE: This command takes a minute or more.

## Stop server #

PROTIP: Do not stop the Jenkins instance by clicking the red X to close the command window Jenkins runs under.
   Doing a soft-stop enables Jenkins to save data to memory rather than potentially lose data during a hard and sudden stop.

0. Stop the server by escaping the process.

   * Ctrl+C on Windows
   * command+C on Macs

   &nbsp;

   The response is:
   
   ```
   INFO: JVM is terminating. Shutting down Winstone
   ```

## First-time setup #


### Use HTTPS #

PROTIP: Encrypt over the wire by using https instead of https.
    
0. Start Jenkins again using more parameters:

   <pre><strong>
   java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=-1 --httpsPort=8081 ‚ÄìhttpListenAddress=0.0.0.0
   </strong></pre>

    Value -1 turns off the port.

    ‚ÄìhttpListenAddress=0.0.0.0 allows remote access, while 127.0.0.1 does not.

1\. The whole page is called a **Dashboard**.
2\. **Breadcrumbs** show the hierarchy of page navigation.
3\. Menu items are within a **Sidebar**.
4\. Under the **Build Queue** heading.
5\. Under the **Build Executor Status** heading.
6\. To the right of the **All** view ???
7\. Under the **Name** column are jobs and projects.
8\. Build.
9\. Different colors of icons under the **S** column indicate differing **build status**.
10\. Different colors of icons under the **W** column indicate differing **uild trend**, 
   where yellow sunshine is good and a thundercloud is bad.

## Server Status #

Use the process status command to find the process ID to kill:

   <tt><strong> ps -eaf | grep jenkins </strong></tt>

   A sample response:

<pre>
  501  4137     1   0 Thu06AM ??         2:54.41 /usr/bin/java -Dmail.smtp.starttls.enable=true -jar /usr/local/opt/jenkins/libexec/jenkins.war --httpListenAddress=127.0.0.1 --httpPort=8080
  501 14728 14384   0  6:31PM ttys002    0:00.00 grep jenkins
</pre>

To remove the Jenkins process:

    kill 4137


## Configure User Security #

Jenkins installation options are described at:
 
   * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins

   By default, Jenkins stores its configuration files in the user's home folder at `~/.jenkins`.

   To make a Jenkins server completely public (and open to hacking)
   use a text editor to edit ~jenkins/.ssh/config
   to add `StrictHostKeyChecking no`.

0. Create a key without a passphrase, per https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

0. Login under user named Jenkins (if applicable):

   ```
   sudo su jenkins
   ```

0. Copy your github key to Jenkins .ssh folder.

   ```
   cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github*  /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
   ```

0. Raname the keys:

   ```
   mv id_rsa_github id_rsa
   mv id_rsa_github.pub id_rsa.pub
   ```


<a id="AddUser"></a>

### Add User Permissions #

0. Bring up Jenkins in your default browser:

   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8081/">
   https://localhost:8081/</a>

If you don't see the full menu (shown on the right), you don't have some permissions.

As with other systems, granting permissions is typically done only by the Administrator of the system.

0. Click **Manage Jenkins** on the left menu of the Dashboard screen.
0. Click **Configre Global Security**.

   <amp-img width="481" height="57" alt="jenkins2 5-manage-config-global-security-962x114" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/15433535/f9da19d8-1e6f-11e6-8e30-e66dc2cbc9c4.png"></amp-img>

0. Check Enable Security.
0. If you have an LDAP, select that, or check Use Jenkin's own user database. But you'll have to add each user.
0. Check **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy** to limit Anonymous users Read-only access.

   PROTIP: Rather than specifying individual users and their permissions,
   the preferred approach is to firt assign individual users to a group in LDAP,
   then assign permission to the group.

0. For an existing user/group, check boxes to its right.

   <amp-img width="600" height="47" alt="jenkins-security-permissions-matrix-1420x112" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/11181173/6ea5dfe4-8c1d-11e5-9674-ef0e7d88ef8d.png"></amp-img>

## Nodes for scalability #

 A Jenkins server can scale by adding **nodes** to spread build work across several servers running different operating systems.

 Look at the **Load Statistics** UI to see whether additional nodes are necessary.
 
 Jenkins slave nodes can be started by the master using several launch methods:

  * Launch slave agents on Unix machines via SSH
  * Launch slave agents via Java Web Start
  * Launch slave via execution of command on the Master
  * Let Jenkins control this Window slave as a Windows service

0. Setup a node as a VirtualBox. TODO.

0. In Configure Server, a node can be setup as a **Virtualbox** 
   URL such as http://localhost:18083/.

0. In Manage Nodes, configure a VBox host.
1. Run the box by clicking the icon at the far right of the node listed.
2. Launch Slave Agent to start the machine.

<a id="Node_Security"></a>

### From a slave node #

0. From a slave command line, connect to a Jenkins master:
 
   ```
   java -jar slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://jenkins-master:8081/computer/Test Node/slave-agent.jnlp
   ```

 Several **executors** can be running simultaneously.
 This number is specified within the **Manage Jenkins** UI.
 
 Tool locations (such as Github) is also specified in that UI.

 Nodes are described at:
 * https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds

<a id="Builds">
## Build Projects</a>
Jenkins was originally created for automating the building (compilation) of java programs.
But Jenkins is ALSO used for other types of work.
Nevertheless, the Jenkins term <strong>"build"</strong> 
is another word for what operating systems call a <strong>"job"</strong> (unit of batch work).

Builds/jobs can be automatically triggered several ways:

 * after other projects
 * periodically on a schedule
 * poll a version control system for changes
