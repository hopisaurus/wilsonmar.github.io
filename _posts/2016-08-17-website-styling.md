Here are tools and rules I try to use for styling websites.

## Websites I love #


## PROTIP rules #

Many developers have declared "enough" and have switched to HTML5-only websites
as less and less enterprises have given up on demanding their users only use Microsoft-only browers.

* Use HTML5 tags (&LTheader) instead of &LTdiv 

* Use CSS IDs (#tag) for navigation JavaScript
* Use CSS classes (.tag) for styling

* Use <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes/">
   HTML5 Data-* attributes</a>
   to supply additional information

* Use

## Tools #

* <a target="_blank" href="http://specificitykeegan.st/">CSS Specificity calculator</a>
   based on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.htm#specificity</a>
   this W3 standard</a>.

* Identify CSS tags not referenced in HTML

* Compress


## Naming conventions #

This prevents errors:

* Use hyphens to separate words in a sentence
* Use underlines to separate compound words
* Use functional names such as "submit-button" 
* Avoid names such as "red-button" what it looks like

These are from:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://bem.info/methodology/">
   BEM.info</a> (Block, Element, Modifier) frontend development methodology
   to provide transparency and meaning
