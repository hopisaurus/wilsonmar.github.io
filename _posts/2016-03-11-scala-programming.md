I don't want to repeat what others have already written.

My aim with this effort is a faster, easier way to 
show how to build a full application using Scala, 
not just to impress others about supposedly cool concepts.

So I will be organizing this into a hands-on approach to introduce the Scala programming language in a sequence for quick learning.

Compilation is covered in the Ecosystem page.

## Scala vs. Java

With Scala:

* Functions as objects.
* All types are objects.
* Immutable objects

* Type inference
* Domain specific language (DSL) support
* <a href="#Traits">Traits</a>
* Closures (vs Java 8)
* Concurrency support (inspired by Erlang

## Static Code Analyzer

I think that Static Code Analyzers should be run on the most basic of code,
by the most junior of developers.
This is so one doesn't develop bad habits being introduced by
most programming tutorials available, which use 
naming conventions not safe for enterprise work.

Some "best practices" documents:

* <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/">
twitter.github.io/effectivescala</a>
presents "best practices" for Scala at Twitter. 
Useful for understanding idioms in Twitter's code.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices">
   github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices</a>
   makes use of 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">
   RFC 2119 - Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</a>

   ("Cargo-cult" - sounds like a rock band.)

   Alex divides his rules this way:

   1. hygienic-rules
   2. language-rules
   3. architecture
   4. concurrency-parallelism.
   5. actors

   It's a rather "chicken or the egg" issue -
   how can someone understand what to avoid unless they understand what 
   it is they are avoiding?



## Exception mechanism similar to Java's

Scala has an exception mechanism similar to Java's.

Let's look at an I/O call:

{% highlight scala %}
def MeThrowsException() {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Exception thrown");
}

try{
    MeThrowsException();
    // println("this line is never executed");
} catch {
  case e: IllegalArgumentException => println("illegal arg. exception");
  case e: IllegalStateException    => println("illegal state exception");
  case e: IOException              => println("IO exception");
  case e: Exception => println("exception caught: " + e);
} finally {
    println("this code is always executed");
}

{% endhighlight %}


<a name="Traits"></a>

### Traits like an abstract class 

Scala offers traits instead of Java interfaces.

Traits in Scala are best described as “interfaces that can provide concrete members.” 
A class gets its concrete members for free
by mixing in a trait and implementing the abstract members.

https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2013/05/30/traits-how-scala-tames-multiple-inheritance/

In addition to serving as pure interfaces, traits can also provide bundles of functionality like Java’s AbstractFoo (e.g. AbstractList, etc.) classes. A trait can have a few abstract methods and a number of concrete members implemented in terms of those abstract members. 
A trait can be added to any Scala class.

Like interfaces with implementations or controlled multiple inheritance.

According to
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_%28computer_programming%29">Wikipedia</a>,
"traits are a set of methods that can be used to extend the functionality of a class."

<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/basics.html">
Twitter</a> defines:
"Traits are collections of fields and behaviors that you can extend or mixin to your classes." and offers this code example which extends traits using keywords:

   ```
   class BMW extends Car with Shiny {
   val brand = "BMW"
   val shineRefraction = 12
   }
   ```

The above is dependent upon these definitions:

   ```
   trait Car {
   val brand: String
   }

   trait Shiny {
   val shineRefraction: Int
   }

   class BMW extends Car {
   val brand = "BMW"
   }
   ```

* A class can extend only one class, but
* a class can extend several traits. 


<a name="CaseClasses"></a>

## Methods as operators


   ```
   println(3 max 4) // => 4
   ``` 


<a name="CaseClasses"></a>

## Case Classes

A case in front of a class definition makes it a factory method
which creates getter classes:

   ```
   case SomeClass(arg1:String)
   ```

   With Scala, a **companion object** is where static objects are defined.



## Scala is a New Paradigm from Java

   ```
   m map { t ==> val (s, i) = t; (s, i+1) } 
   ```

with "Sytactic sugar" removed to Java map function:

   ```
   m.map({ t ==> val (s, i) = t; (s, i+1) })
   ```

A Tuple is a fixed list which can be typed differently and
can be a container f
or other data types.
Since Sashmi and Onigiri are instances of the same type Sushi:

   ```
   val bento:(Sushi, Sushi) = (new Sashimi, new Onigiri)
   ```

Arity of 22 

Scala thus is able to identify issues at compile time.

## Tests

```
package X

class X extends FlatSpec{

}
```

import org.salatest.FlatSpec

## Run Tests
The tilde prefix detects if code changed and runs:

   ```
   ~test
   ```


## Pattern Matching

## Read XML

{% highlight scala %}
import scala.xml._
import java.net._
import scala.io.Source
val theUrl = "https://www.google.com/#q=weather+forecast+san+francisco"
val newString = Source.fromURL(new URL(theUrl)).mkString
val xml = XML.loadString(newString)
val newcity1 = xml \\ "location" \\ "@city"
val newstate1 = xml \\ "location" \\ "@region"
val newtemperature1 = xml \\ "condition" \\ "@temp"
println(newcity1 + " " + newstate1 + " " + newtemperature1)
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="Arrays"></a>

## Arrays

Define an array containing 10 items (0-9):

   ```
   var myArray : Array[String] = new Array[String](10);
   ```


<a name="MatchCase"></a>

## Match case

Scala simplifies on Java's switch statement by 
not falling through cases until it hits a break operator.
Thus, Scala doesn't need a break operator.

Also, Scala's match can return a value (myResult):

```
var myVar = "theValue";

var myResult =
   myVar match {
      case "someValue"   => println(myVar + " 1");
      case "thisValue"   => println(myVar + " 2");
      case "theValue"    => println(myVar + " 3");
      case "doubleValue" => println(myVar + " 4");
   }
println(myResult);
   ```
