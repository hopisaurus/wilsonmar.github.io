There are many ways your files can die or disappear:

   * You destroy a file by replacing the new version with an old version
   * Your laptop gets lost, stolen, or damaged beyond repair

   * Fire or theft or drive failure destroys your backup devices
   * Your cloud backup vendor goes out of business or charges too much

TD;LR Use several techniques for peace of mind with data on your laptops:

   1. For a complete backup (including operating system files), use a portable USB drive. This is the lowest cost option.

      * If you have a Apple MacBook, use Time Machine with a <strong>portable drive</strong>
      * If you have a Windows machine, it's best to get a 3rd software
      <br /><br />

   2. Do full backups to a local network attached storage (NAS) device via wi-fi every night (or whenever you sleep), and public network access is shut down
   3. Mirror the hard disk automatically on the NAS
   4. Setup automatic incremental backups to a network backup service at lunch when the public internet is available

There are reasons for each:

   1. Local backups to a USB are useful to restore completely in less than an hour
   2. Attached storage devices backup off your machine via wifi without you having to plug anything in
   3. All drives fail eventually
   4. Backups to a cloud protects your data from disasters at your home

There is a weakness to each as well:

   1. Backups can take up a lot of room on your computer. And it's a hassle to remember to plug in the USB drive.
   2. NAS drives cost $150 and up.
   3. Mirrored drives cost double that.
   4. Assume that anything in a cloud will eventually be available to everyone.
   Strong encryption helps, but do not guarantee privacy.

If you're a developer or modern writer, continue to:

   * Commit small changes to your code into a local git repository within each project folder
   * Commit your locally tested code up on GitHub.com or equivalent

   PROTIP: Being able to get back to different versions of your machine is important
   because a virus or mistake can destroy files you don't notice until months later.

PROTIP: Schedule time ahead to make sure you have a fresh backup before you leave home,
in case your laptop is lost, stolen, or damaged while on the road.

## Time Machine #

The Time Machine software that comes with Apple MacOS is one of its best features.

   * Ability to rebuild from a backup disk in case of main drive meltdown

   * Completely transparent, "set-it-and-forget-it" backup operation

   * Incremental backups (changes only) for every hour for a day, every day for a month, and every week until the backup disk is full.

Windows 7's Shadow Copy Service is lacking because it won't help you a bit when your disk crashed.

## NAS Options #

### Hard Drive Failure Rate #

There are more industrial vendors and devices:

   * Synology DSN
   * QNAP QTS
   * WD MyCloud EX2
   * Seagate Home NAS
   * Netgear

The focus of this article is on consumer models.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/what-hard-drive-should-i-buy/">
Backblaze</a> analyzed thousands of hard drives and found:

   * Seagate had the highest failure rate for 1 TB drives (14% is hugh!)
   * But lower failures on 4 TB drives (3% per year)
   * Western Digital had lower failure rates than Seagate on all size drives
   * Hitachi drives had the lowest failure rate (below 1%) on all size drives

3% a year is still a rather risky.
Would you accept 14 out of 100 failures from your toilet or microwave oven?

Thus, do both.

### Price of NAS #

BestBuy sells both Western Digital My Cloud and Seagate NAS.
Amazingly, Amazon had the same price.

$158 for the 4 TB.

### Operational Considerations #

PROTIP: The devices make noise when operating, so have them all in a room away from where you want to sleep quietly.
A sound-proof room where you watch loud movies?

The initial backup requires special handling since
neither of the NAS device manufacturers allow its USB port to obtain files from your laptop (like a USB portable drive).
Its USB port is to plug in an additional USB portable drive.

PROTIP: Make the initial backup set by plugging in the RG-45 network cable into your laptop.
MacBooks would require an additional adapter.

Both have a mobile app for iOS and Android
that works on the common local wi-fi network.

PROTIP: You'll need to keep your laptop running at night for this to happen

Both have DNLA capability to play back videos to a TV also having DLNA feature.


### Western Digital My Cloud #

A 5 minute non-technical overview by a cheerleader:
<amp-youtube data-videoid="qYTlljqodmU" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270"></amp-youtube>

WARNING: My Cloud connects to a wi-fi hub,
so the backup device needs to be near the hub.
That may be OK since you'll want both plugged into a UPS to protect from electrical sags.

WD has its My Cloud mobile app for iOS and Android
that works on the common local wi-fi network.

Complaints about this on Amazon and elsewhere include:

   * It consistently 'goes away' and I have to unplug and plug it back in.
   * You can ONLY backup on the Home/local network  not on a connected device over the internet.
   * "Slow"
   * Different users (laptops) share files via dragging to a common Public folder.

### Seagate Personal Cloud NAS #

Each laptop requires a different user account.
Folders cannot be shared, even by the administrator.

Seagate is faster than WD MyCloud.

Folders marked public are visible to all on the wi-fi,
but not from the internet without a password.

The most frequent backup time is once per hour.
No "backup now".

You can pull in from the internet files from social media websites
such as Facebook, Twitter.

The iTunes player doesn't work. You have to use Seagate's program.

## Cloud vendors #

http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-online-backup-service/
provides a great list of features.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/">Crashplan</a>
   (from Code42) offers premium services at a premium price --
   $150 per year for families, $60 a year for individuals) for "unlimited" storage.
   This price is about $12 a month, which is about what many generic cloud vendors charge.

   However, its desktop app has the unique option of peer-to-peer backups as well.
   It works on Windows, but its Mac edition does not offer versioning.

   CrashPlan can backup the NAS drive,
   which makes a mirror unnecessary.
   This is a key selling point.

   CrashPlan's client is written in Java for cross-platform support.
   But it installs its own version of the JRE, so you won't have to hassle with installation.
   However, you'll want to shut down apps when it runs.

* Carbonite does not currently offer Macs equivalent features.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arqbackup.com/">
  ArqBackup.com</a> stores data in the various generic cloud vendors
  (Amazon Cloud Drive, Amazon Web Services (S3 or Glacier), Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage (including "Nearline"), Dropbox, OneDrive, GreenQloud, DreamObjects, etc.),

  This approach enables you to take advantage of free offers such as unlimited picture storage on Amazon Cloud Drive for Amazon Prime users.

  The company points users to <a target="_blank" href="http://sreitshamer.github.io/arq_restore/">
  an open-source restore software</a> which requires use of a command-line interface for those comfortable with crafting a command such as:

  <pre>
  $ arq_restore restore 32D9D7A2-3B3E-4BE7-B85B-0605AF24F570 password 7C554E65-4324-4B81-9675-4D6EA686B0DD 10000 aws AKIAIPXLWYHBMEO22ZNQ QMqT0cdSuHs6eCanSVGr/odThlgoBqYfiWuOsOGI akiaiyuk3n3tme6l4hfa.com.haystacksoftware.arq
