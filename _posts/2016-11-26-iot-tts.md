This page describes ways to get your Pi to turn text to speech you hear on a speaker.

Cloud-based services leverage powerful servers
to provide the most precise speech synthesis.

But programs can run locally on board the computer.

<hr />

Programs that run on-board the Pi to output voice include Festival and its derivative Flite.

## Festival

Festival is written by The Centre for Speech Technology Research at the University of Edingburgh (UK).
It offers a framework for building speech synthesis systems. It offers full text to speech through a number APIs: from shell level, via a command interpreter, as a C++ library, from Java, and an Emacs editor interface. 

Festival is multi-lingual (currently British English, American English, and Spanish. Other groups work to release new languages for the system.  Festival is in the package manager for the Raspberry Pi making it very easy to install.

0. Install

   sudo apt-get install festival -y

   `-y` avoid confirmation of 19.2 MB disk space usage.

0. Identify voices from 

   https://packages.debian.org/jessie/festival-voice

   NOTE: A 16khz sample rate is clearer than 8khz,
   but require more disk space and takes up more CPU.

0. Install a voice file specifically for processing by Festival on Debian:

   sudo apt-get install festvox-rablpc16k -y

   This "British English male speaker" voice takes 9 MB.

   PROTIP: Only one voice is needed.

0. Send from command line:

   echo "Hello Wilson!" | festival --tts

   NOTE: There may be some "electrical" sound behind 
   a robot talking quickly.

0. Use a Chrome browser to see the documentation
   and on-line demo:

   http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/

   The Firefox browser needs a plug-in to be installed.

0. Python code to invoke TTS from text in a variable and in a file:

   <pre>
import subprocess
text = '"Hello world"'
subprocess.call('echo '+text+'|festival --tts', shell=True)
&nbsp;
text = '"You are listening to text to speech synthesis using Festival package from the University Edingburg in the UK."'
filename = 'hello'
file=open(filename,'w')
file.write(text)
file.close()
subprocess.call('festival --tts '+filename, shell=True)
   <pre>


## Flite

Flite is a lighter version of Festival built specifically for embedded systems.
It runs faster than Festival because it doesn't have 
Festival's complex scripting language or phoneme handling.
