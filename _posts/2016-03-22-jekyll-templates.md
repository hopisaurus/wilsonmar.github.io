This article lists and evaluates templates for Jekyll, 
which drives GitHub.io static websites.

The structure of content (.md files) created for display using 
Jekyll makes it easy (with only a few edits) 
to switch the site to use any number of 
other Jekyll themes / templates.


### Jekyll Theme shops #

My personal favorite is:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyll.tips/templates/">jekyll.tips/templates</a>
   by Mike Neumegen (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mikeneumegen">@mikeneumegen</a>,
   CEO of @CloudCannonApp, a SaaS services provider for Jekyll) 

Within the Jekyll repository on GitHub:

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes">
    github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes</a>

Premium (paid) themes so you get updates and support, for less than $30.

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllthemes.io">jekyllthemes.io</a>

This is an affiliate for other sites offering the same themes for less.

### Themes from Michael Rose #

Content on this website was created by editing markdown text (index.md files)
stored on GitHub.com.
The HTML sent to your browser for display is generated from markdown using
Ruby running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 3.0 rendering modifications of the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/">
minimal-mistakes theme from GitHub</a> by Michael Rose.

Michael also created the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll">
skinny-bones-jekyll theme demo</a> forkable
<a target="_blank" href="https://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/">
from GitHub</a>.
It features more use of graphics, and allows for localization.

### Installation and Generation #

Michael Rose presents a concise description of
<a target="_blank" href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/">
how to install the minimal-mistakes theme</a>.
This post augments and clarifies it.

Begin by making a folder and populating it on my local machine.

There is both a Master branch and a Develop branch.

I don't care about all the change history, so I click "Download ZIP"
and unzip it into that folder rather than:

    git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git

### Grunt example #

After downloading, have Maven pull in dependencies based on the Gemfile:

   bundle install

This causes the list of dependencies in the Gemfile to be downloaded.

Behind the scenes is a running of the **Gruntfie.js** that comes with the theme.
It defines the parameters of various tasks that are downloaded:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-clean">clean</a>
clears files and folders.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint">jshint</a>
validates files with JSHint, based on the **.jshintrc** configuration file at the root folder.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify">uglify</a>
minfies files with UglifyJS.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch">watch</a>
runs tasks whenever watched files change.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin">imagemin</a>
minifies PNG graphics files.
* <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-svgmin">grunt-svgmin</a>
minifies SVG graphics files.

NOTE: File names beginning with a dot are hidden.
