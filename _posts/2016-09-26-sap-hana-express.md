This is a hands-on tutorial on installing SAP HANA Express 
in a HXE virtual instance running under VMWare Fusion 8 on a Mac.

## Get Download Manager #

PROTIP: Instead of downloading the "Getting_Started_HANAexpress_VM.pdf",
look at the webpage<br />

   HXEDownloadManager.jar

   ### Server-only #

0. Keep defaults of Image Virtual Machine checked.
0. Uncheck the "Getting Started".
0. Select "Server only" and press OK.

   Selecting "Server + applications" means <strong>development apps</strong>, which include XS Advanced (XSA) and Web IDE.
   These you can download later.

   ### VMWare #

0. Click Play.

   The pdf downloaded provides these credentials:

   * For Password enter the temporary password HXEHana1
   <br /><br />

0. Follow the Getting Started to change passwords, assign IP, etc.
   
   QUESTION: Is there a shell script that can do all that?

   It will "stop working after the default grace period of 60-90 days."

0. Start SAP HANA studio to get the Hardware Key for registration on <br />
