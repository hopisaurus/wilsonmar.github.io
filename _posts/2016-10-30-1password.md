Below is the script for a video course I'm writing.


## Introduction

In this course you will learn how to protect your bank account and other 
websites from being hacked (as easily).

This is probably the most important tutorial I've created
because it's one thing we can do to keep our accounts safe from predators.

It's not safe to use a single password on several websites
because hackers use programs to try passwords.

It's also not safe anymore to use a pattern to vary passwords slightly on each site
because passwords from many breached websites are open,
so hackers can now recognize patterns from several sites.

We should also use different user names for each site.

We can keep a list of passwords in a file.

But what if our laptop gets lost or stolen?

So what we need is a way to generate a different strong password for each website we use.

That's what 1Password does.

1Password is unique in that it allows its password file to not leave the computer,
and be stored in some cloud server for hackers to steal.

The software is called one password because you use one password to access 
all the passwords it saves.

This enables you to open the same website on any browser.

Moreover, this would enable someone to have access to your accounts in case you are disabled or die.

## Install

Software is installed on your operating system.

Software also needs to be installed on each internet browser you have installed.



## Erase passwords kept by Browsers

Internet browsers save passwords.

But this can be dangerous because any site you visit can potentially get at the file.

So we need a way

## Install 1Password

## Remove passwords in browsers


### Google Chrome browser

### Microsoft IE browser

### Mozilla Firefox browser

### Apple Safari browser

### Other browsers

   Since work is needed on each specific browser,
   the last I checked the new Brave browser has not been.

## Transfer to a Windows machine

## Transfer to an iPhone

## Transfer to an Android
