This diagram 
is an example of the <strong>sequencing</strong> 
of deliverables for evangelism:

Different colors in the diagram are arbitrary, 
to delineate level of secrecy or ownership by different people.
This will be different for each organization.

1. We start with the <strong>pain points</strong>, where people need to take action 
   and are likely to be looking for <strong>solutions</strong>,
   which is the definition of a sales prospect.

2. Prospects are likely to encounter <strong>competitors</strong>,
   so a strategy is needed to best answer concerns, 
   both verbally and in real products and services.

0. Ideally, differentiation and positioning is summarized by <strong>keywords</strong> 
   "sound bytes" and Twitter hashtags used in emails and titles of presentations.

0. Ideally, <strong>statistics</strong> about customers, 
   both indistry-wide and internally 
   would drive messaging rather than just empty slogans.

0. Real people and their organizations
0. and their stories ("proof points")
0. in presentation graphics so
0. social media reflects reality and sincerity.
0. But we need to show Return on Investment in
0. blogs and longer form communications
0. summarized in scripted videos to get people into
0. meetups and conference presentations.

0. On the technical side, <strong>sample applications</strong> are used in
0. <strong>benchmark</strong> statistics which provide a factual and repeatable basis to prove competitiveness.
0. Such are what external industry analysts (such as Gartner) can use to make their case for you.

0. Yes, <strong>books</strong> are still helpful for publicity and credibility.
0. But <strong>video courses</strong> with student interaction is what 
   delivers capable users who can
0. achieve useful results during <strong>Hackathons</strong> and actual deployments of your offering.
