This diagram is an example of the <strong>deliverables</strong> necessary for evangelism:

Different colors in the diagram 
delineate possible levels of secrecy or ownership by different teams.

The <strong>sequence</strong> of what comes first, second, and so forth
can also be different for each organization.

Let's look now at the <strong>wisdom</strong>, the PROTIPs, behind each item in sequence.

1. We start with the <strong>pain points</strong>, where people need to take action 
   and are likely to be looking for <strong>solutions</strong>,
   which is the definition of a sales prospect.

2. Prospects are likely to encounter an organization's <strong>competitors</strong>,
   so a strategy is needed to best answer concerns, 
   both verbally and in real products and services.

0. Ideally, differentiation and positioning is summarized by <strong>keywords</strong> 
   "sound bytes" and Twitter hashtags used in emails and titles of presentations.

0. But rather than just empty slogans,
   <strong>statistics</strong> about customers (their concerns, where they live,
   both indistry-wide and your particular sub-groups)
   should drive messaging.

0. Real people and their organizations 
0. and their stories ("proof points")
0. in presentation graphics so
0. <strong>social media</strong> reflects reality and sincerity.

0. Validated "proof points" in testimonials and surveys are needed to 
   prove Return on Investment on time spent to 
0. view demos, take calls, and read communications.

0. <strong>scripted videos</strong> are essentially short recordings of conversations and 
   conceptual explanations given during
0. live demos, meetups, and conference presentations.

0. On the technical side, <strong>sample applications</strong> are used in
0. <strong>benchmark</strong> statistics which provide a factual and repeatable basis to prove competitiveness.
0. Such are what external industry analysts (such as Gartner) can use to make their case for you.

0. Yes, <strong>books</strong> are still helpful for publicity and credibility.
0. But <strong>video courses</strong> with student interaction is what 
   delivers capable users who can
0. achieve useful results during <strong>Hackathons</strong> and actual deployments of your offering.
