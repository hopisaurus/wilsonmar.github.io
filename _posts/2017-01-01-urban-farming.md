Here are my random notes on growing <a href="#Vegetables">vegetables</a>.
In an apartment. 
Without much sun. 
In the Winter.

## Why farm?

I need food year-round.

I want food that I know hasn't been contaminated with pesticides and poop.

   There is organic produce in a Whole Foods store a block away from me ... 
   It's also <a href="#Expensive">expensive</a>. 
   And ...

I don't need to walk to the store in the cold or heat.

   There no <strong>fresher</strong> way that from plant to mouth.
   And if there is a suicide bomber running into people on my street,
   I can still enjoy a fresh salad. ;)

I want to see whether getting my hands dirty with soil is as "therapeutic" as others say.

   A contrast to the computers I work with all day.

I want to know what <a href="#Varieties">different varieties of vegetables</a> taste like.

   Stores, even Whole Foods, only carry two standard varieties, bred for shelf life,
   not <strong>taste</strong>.

Lastly, I like to talk with people who are into this more than 
people who just hang out in bars drinking.

   There are <a href="#CommunityGarden">community gardens</a>,
   but they are exposed to the elements.


> During WWII 20 million Americans planted "Victory Gardens". They grew 40% of the country's produce supply.


### Why Indoors?

Most people now live in urban areas.

Indoors there is already moderated climate controls (from heaters and air conditioners).

   We don't have to constantly worry about crops dying from freezing or too much heat.

Indoors there is protection from deer, foxes, coyotes, racoons, possums, birds, insects,
and other predators that desimate crops.

Much <strong>less weeding</strong>, which is the vast majority of gardening work.

Most of all, it's convenient. 
Computer monitoring and advice is making it even easier now.

However...

Indoor farming requires more purchases than a <a href="#CommunityGarden">community garden</a>,
but consider the risks and hassles as well on alternatives.

   You can do both!



## Humidity

There is a difference in the ideal <strong>humidity</strong> 
for plants vs. for humans and furniture.

Humidity breeds mold that's not good for people.

## Length of time to grow stuff

> "I am a vegatarian because I hate vegetables."

Alright, that quote is a joke, BTW.

2 weeks for <strong>lettuce</strong> - iceberg butter, Romaine.

Herbs - <strong>Basil</strong> for pesto sauce in Italian and Thai food.

Microgreens - lemon basil, arugula/roquette, kale, pink stem radish.

From various seed catalogs:

### Sprouts

Sprouts are seeds that just germinated.
Great to add on sandwiches with avocado.

They are nutrient rich and full of flavor.
But that means you have to rinse them <strong>4 or 5 times a day</strong> 
or you'll get Salmonella bacteria poisoning (fever, headache, abdominal cramps, vomitting, diarrhea up to 7 days).

http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Irrigation-Controller/
describes use of a Raspberry Pi controlling
a 24 VAC solenoid for a 3/4" hose spigot.

An AC solenoid valve turns water on when voltage is applied, and turns it off when the power is off. The drawback is that it uses AC voltage, requiring an adapter to convert the wall voltage, 120 VAC, into the 24 VAC voltage needed to trigger the valve. Outdoor Installation likely requires an extension cord.

A DC solenoid valve allows for a battery powered system. It can easily be modified to be wireless and powered by renewable energy using a medium solar panel (~10 W). However, most DC irrigation valves are latching solenoids and require switching the valve lead polarity to turn water on and off.

The Solid State Relay, or relay, is the intermediary switch between the RPi and the solenoid valve. This tutorial uses a Crouzet Model OAC5-315; its input is 3 - 8 VDC and its output is between 24 - 120 VAC at 1A.



<a name="Expensive"></a>

## Expensive?

Remember there are equipment costs to outdoor farming:

   * hoes
   * fences
   * gloves
   * cart to haul dirt
   * etc.
   <br /><br />

Both indoor and outdoor farms require:

   * seeds
   * hoses (drip)
   * sprinkler heads
   * fertilizer (nutrients)
   * temperature monitoring
   * etc.
   <br /><br />

One difference is the whole animal/land cycle of manure in permaculture.


You would need to buy seeds, nutrient solutions, substrates, watering timers,  
monitoring (for temperature, light, pH, CO2), grow lights, racks, enclosures.

The economics Farming indoors is a big business:

* http://cubicfarms.com has a system to grow vegetables at scale indoors
  at Langley, BC and Ottawa, Canada.

* http://www.wsj.com/articles/are-shipping-containers-the-future-of-farming-1465393797

Yes, it takes some money to get setup, 
but it's an investment for overall savings long term.


### Greenhouse gardening

Greenhouses provide some protection from the cold and harsh sun.

## Cases

Enclosures keep light from grow lights bounce onto plants.
