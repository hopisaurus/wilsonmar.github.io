One aspect of the "A" of the JAM stack - APIs called by JavaScript from within static sites -
is shopping.

Here are the offerings:

If you're selling a few each month, you don't want monthly charges.<br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gumroad.com/">
   Gumroad</a> charges 5% + $2 on each sale, on top of credit card charges.
   

If you have at least $500 steady sales each month,<br /> 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.snipcart.com/">
   Snipcart.com</a> charges $10 a month if they do not get more than $500 from the 2%
   they charge on every transaction.
