What is the purpose of social media?

## <a name="Influence">Influence</a> #

It's not enough just to have an account with some words and pictures.

What percent of your activity results in some <strong>action</strong> by readers:

   * Buy something

   * Retweet to expand <strong>reach</strong>

   * Link to your site from their website

   * Forward to someone else

   * Download a white paper (pdf)

   * Friend you on Facebook

   * etc.

An effective <strong>influencer</strong> is one who can get people to do the above.


## Measurements #

<strong>Hit count</strong> is the number of people who landed on the site.
The same person who looks at 10 pages would register 10 hits.

<strong>Unique visitors</strong> is the number of unique IP addresses which visited the site.
The same person who visited 10 pages would register as one visitor.

<strong>CTR (Click Through Rate)</strong>
is the percentage of visitors who clicked on an ad banner. 
If an ad is seen by 1,000 people, but clicked by 200 visitors:

   <pre>
   (Number of Clicks / Number of impressions) x 100
   (200 / 1,000) x 100 = .02
   </pre>

Those who <strong>pay</strong> ad networks to have banners appear on that network's sites 
need to calculate the <strong>cost</strong> of ad placements:

<strong>CPM (Cost Per thousand)</strong> 
uses M in the abbreviation because M is the Roman numeral for thousand.
The "per" refers to the number of unique <strong>impressions</strong>.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://mobileadvertisingworks.wordpress.com/2008/06/18/what-is-cpm-cpc-cpa-and-ctr-basics-of-mobile-publishing/">
   NOTE:</a> CPM rates were once (pre yr 2000 bubble-burst era) as much as $75, 
   but have now dropped to as little as $1 CPM.

<strong>CPC (Cost Per Click)</strong> 
refers to the number of times some visitor clicks on an ad banner.

   NOTE: CPC rates can be as high as $3 per click or as little as 5 cents per click. It depends on your product and your market – amongst other factors, the more competition there is – the higher
   the rate.

<strong>CPS (Cost Per Sale)</strong> is the most desirable measure because that's the ultimate
action for real revenue on ecommerce sites.

<strong>CPR (Cost Per Registration)</strong>
counts those who finishes filling up an enquiry form.

<strong>CPA (Cost Per Action)</strong>
can include registrations, sales. 




## Helping association #

An IT education school makes 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0slsoyEhz40">
videos</a> from useful blog articles.

   Is the effort of creating a video worth the number of views?


PROTIP: It is rare to get more than 5% on messages delivered.
This means most tweets are never read by anyone.

PROTIP: However, tweets remain on the internet forever, 
so someone doing searches may find it days, months, or even years later.

## Multiple Twitter accounts #

Some companies find it useful to have several twitter accounts:

   * One account for the corporate name

   * A hashtag for each brand or product name

   * AskXYZ for questions

   * One account for the conference each year

   * A hashtag for <strong>users</strong>of each brand or product name

   * The accounts of each person affliated with the above

TODO: Brand positioning.

PROTIP: If your website is .io or some other TLD,
include that in your company hashtag name to avoid confusion.



## Best times to tweet #

Popular evangelists note that they tweet the same message <strong>several times a day</strong>
to catch the attention of people in different time zones around the world.

Services such as HootSuite
enable messages to be stored for future delivery at specific times.


## Association #

Here's a great example of associating authoritative and inspirational messaging to a brand:

   <amp-img alt="social twitter nike justdoit 20160725 478x120-10kb.png" width="478" height="120" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14143059/17757101/b8d23970-64a1-11e6-90f1-17af4d1a0d58.png"></amp-img>


## Competitive Association #

When an organization makes a media splash,
competitors may hijack the hashtags being promoted
by tweeting the competitor's tag along with their own, which associates the communications together.
