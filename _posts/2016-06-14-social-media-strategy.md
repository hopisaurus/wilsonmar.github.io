What is the purpose of social media?

## <a name="Influence">Influence</a> #

It's not enough just to have an account with some words and pictures.

What percent of your activity results in some action by readers:

   * Buy something

   * Retrweet to expand <strong>reach</strong>

   * Link to your site from their website

   * Forward to someone else

   * Download a white paper (pdf)

   * Friend you on Facebook

   * etc.

An effective <strong>influencer</strong> is one who can get people to do the above.

   Is the effort of creating a video worth the number of views?


PROTIP: It is rare to get more than 5% on messages delivered.
This means most tweets are never read by anyone.

PROTIP: However, tweets remain on the internet forever, 
so someone doing searches may find it days, months, or even years later.

## Multiple Twitter accounts #

Some companies find it useful to have several twitter accounts:

   * One account for the corporate name

   * A hashtag for each brand or product name

   * AskXYZ for questions

   * One account for the conference each year

   * A hashtag for <strong>users</strong>of each brand or product name

   * The accounts of each person affliated with the above

TODO: Brand positioning.

PROTIP: If your website is .io or some other TLD,
include that in your company hashtag name to avoid confusion.



## Best times to tweet #

Popular evangelists note that they tweet the same message <strong>several times a day</strong>
to catch the attention of people in different time zones around the world.

Services such as HootSuite
enable messages to be stored for future delivery at specific times.


## Association #

Here's a great example of associating authoritative and inspirational messaging to a brand:

## Competitive Association #

When an organization makes a media splash,
competitors may hijack the hashtags being promoted
by tweeting the competitor's tag along with their own, which associates the communications together.
