There is not shortage to the number of programs available to edit code.

Free:

   * Atom from GitHub (free)
   * Microsoft Code (free)

Licensed:

   * <a href="#SublimeTextz">Sublime Text</a> : $89 nagware
   * Notepad++ (on Windows)

IDEs:

   * IntelliJ from JetBrains
   * Visual Studio from Microsoft

## Sublime Text Text Editor 

Use the Sublime Text 2 text editor from the command line,
make a symlink to subl. 
Assuming you've placed Sublime Text 2 in the Applications folder, and that you have a ~/bin directory in your path, run:

<tt><strong>
sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
</strong></tt>

Use the Sublime text editor to open the profile file:
<strong>subl .bash_profile</strong>

Alternately, use the editor built into a Mac:
<strong>vim .bash_profile</strong>

To get out of VIM, type: 

<pre>
:q to quit (short for :quit)
:q! to quit without saving (short for :quit!)
:wq to write and quit (think write and quit)
:x to write and quit (shorter than :wq)
:qa to quit all (short for :quitall)
</pre>


To use Sublime Text 2 as the editor for many commands that prompt for input, set your EDITOR environment variable:

<pre>
export EDITOR='subl -w'
</pre>
Specifying -w will cause the subl command to not exit until the file is closed.

## Git Editor


If Git finds conflicts, it needs a way to show the differences in a text editor.

Git uses the default vim editor.
To quit the page, press <strong>:q!</strong> (colon to specify a command, q to specify quit, exclaimation point for immediate).

Sublime Text is a popular text editor.

My version of the Grep utility that filters what is piped into it:

<tt><strong>grep --version</strong></tt>
is
<tt>grep (BSD grep) 2.5.1-FreeBSD</tt>

Grep filters what is piped into it.
