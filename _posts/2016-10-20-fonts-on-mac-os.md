I had to install several fonts and throught you'd want to benefit from my experience.

## Download and unzip font folders #


### Dyslexie #

This is not only a casual, fun-looking font, but one that makes it easier to read for those with mild Dylexia.

0. https://www.dyslexiefont.com/

0. Click the Home Edition (or Education or Business)

0. The font file available when I did this was:

   Dyslexie Regular LP172832.ttf


### Hack font for source code #

0. In https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack

0. Scroll down to click "Latest version", which for me was:
   
   https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/releases/download/v2.020/Hack-v2_020-ttf.zip

0. Unzip file: Hack-v2_020-ttf.zip to Hack-v2_020-ttf

0. In Finder navigate to your user's Library folder.

0. Drag and drop the unzipped fonts 


### Open Sans #

0. https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans



<a id="FontBook"></a>

## Apple Font Book app

0. In Finder, choose Go > Applications. Scroll to Font Book and double-click to open it.

0. Click "User".

0. In Finder, drag the new font folder and drop it under the list of user fonts.

0. Delete the font folder and zip file.

This program is described at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749
