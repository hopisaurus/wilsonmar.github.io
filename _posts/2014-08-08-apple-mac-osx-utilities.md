## Grep Utilities

My version of the Grep utility that filters what is piped into it:

<tt><strong>grep --version</strong></tt>

is

   <tt>grep (BSD grep) 2.5.1-FreeBSD</tt>

Grep filters what is piped into it:

   <tt>grep "my string of text" -R</tt>

## Cron Launchd Background Jobs

<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html">This</a> mentions that Apple has deprecated
cron in favor of launchd (a daemon running under the System context).
Since it's a background process, it doesn't present a user interface.

If the system is turned off or asleep, <strong>cron</strong> jobs 
do not execute until the next designated time occurs.

However, launchd job will run when the computer wakes up if 
the computer is <strong>asleep</strong> when the job should have run
(if the StartCalendarInterval key has been set).
