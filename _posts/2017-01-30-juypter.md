The name Jupyter comes from the combination of 
Julia, Python, and R. 

A Jupyter notebook is a web application that runs several 
separate environments containing explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations 
all in one easily <strong>sharable</strong> document.

Notebooks used to be called "iPython" notebooks before other languages were added.

Below is a tutorial is a guided learning experience.
You perform actions in a planned sequence 
that takes you through various features.
Commentary along the way describes concepts to understand.

You will open a notebook, add a Markdown text and add a header
while you try various keyboard shortcuts.

This is based on excellent tutorials from several sources:

<hr />

These occur within a Terminal window:

0. Make a directory to hold Jupyter session files.

0. Navigate to a URL containing Jupyter Notebook files.

   Notebooks are JSON files with the extension <strong>.ipynb</strong>. However, ".txt" is added for storage.

   by the LIGO experiment. 

0. Download a Jupyter Notebook file into your folder.

   You may have to move downloaded files from your Downloads folder.

0. In a new Terminal window, enter Jupyter:

   <pre>
   jupyter notebook
   </pre>

   This creates a (hidden) file <strong>.jupyter</strong> in your home folder, invokes a web server locally, and pops up to your
   default browser a tab:

   http://localhost:8888/tree?token=cdc...

   Additional notebook servers increment the port number
   from 8888.

0. Shutdown the server from Terminal by pressing control + C twice.
0. Enter again.

0. Create a <strong>kernel</strong> by clicking on the New drop-down
   and selecting one.

   NOTE: A kernel is each web page you are on.

0. Click on tab <strong>File</strong> to show all the 
   files and folders in the current directory. 

0. Click Open.

0. List all the currently running notebooks
   by clicking on the Running tab.

0. Select "Python [Conda root]" for a new window (with tabs).

   CAUTION: Just closing the browser leaves a kernel running.

0. To close and halt the kernel, select File, then
   Close and Halt.


   ### Editing

0. Click on the Edit tab.

   NOTE: Cells are where code is written and run. 

   Several of the selections have an icon equivalent.

0. Press Esc key.

0. Each cell can be changed by just clicking on it.

   When the thick left border on a box is colored <strong>green</strong>,
   the box is in <strong>edit mode</strong>.
  
   If you don't see a blinking cursor in the cell, click in the cell.

0. To exit from edit mode to display mode, hold down Shift and press
   Enter. 
   

   ### Command mode

   When a new cell is created, it is in command mode. 

   When the thick left border on a box is colored <strong>blue</strong>,
   the box is in <strong>command mode</strong>. 

   When the bar is blue, press H for a help screen
   about Keyboard shortcuts. It reads:

   "Command mode binds the keyboard to notebook level actions."

   When the bar is blue, press A to create a new cell.

   press B to create a cell below the currently selected cell.


   ### Command Palette
   
   NOTE: This does not work in Firefox and Internet Explorer,
   only in Chrome and Apple Safari.

0. When in command mode, click the little keyboard icon, 
   called the "command palette". 

   A panel appears with a search bar.

0. Press down arrow to scroll down.

   Keyboard shortcuts are on the right side.

0. Enter a command to search for. 
   Helpful for speeding up your workflow instead of looking around in the menus with your mouse. 

   See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

0. Press Esc key.

   ### Python Code

0. Click on the "Code" drop-down, which specifies what is 
   typed in the cell (input box).

0. Select Markdown to format syntax for writing web content.

0. Type in some markdown text.

   https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics

   https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

   Two dollar signs begin and end math entries.

0. To <strong>run</strong> the cell, click the >| icon 
   (used to mean forward to the end) or
   press Shift + Enter or Control + Enter to run the Markdown cell,


   ### Heading

0. Click the up/down arrows to position the cell
   above or below existing runned lines.

0. Select Heading and add a # to reduce the level
   before typing heading text.

   ### Open and Rename Notebook

0. Click Files tab.
0. Click Open.

   Select _____???

0. Click the checkbox to the right of the file name.
0. Click the Rename button.
0. Remove the ".txt" and press OK.
0. Click on the file name itself to open the file.

   A new tab should appear.


   ### Timings

   To get the number of milliseconds a function took to run, 
   put <strong>%timeit</strong> in front of commands to invoke.

   To get the number of seconds it took for a cell to run,
   put <strong>%%timeit</strong> at the top of the cell.


   ### Debugging

   <strong>%pdb</strong> at the top of the cell turns debugging on.

   https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html


   ### Visualization magic keywords

   <strong>%matplotlib inline</strong>

   See http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html
   for docs about magic commands.

   ### nbextensions

0. Code to dynamically loaded:
   <pre>
%%javascript
IPython.load_extensions('custom_shortcuts');
   </pre>

   See https://carreau.gitbooks.io/jupyter-book/content/Jsextensions.html



   ### Raw NBConvert

   NBConvert code modify the UI and behavior of Jupyter itself on the browser.

   So Jupyter notebook extensions are written in javascript and CSS. 

   nbextensions are installed in the directory of the same name, 
   either system wide or in your user profile.
   Their entry point is named <extensionname>.js


   ### Output as HTML

0. To share a Notebook with others who do not have Notebook installed,
   convert the Notebook to HTML or Markdown. 

   PROTIP: Some prefer receiving Markdown text so they paste in blog editing software which formats the Markdown to their own liking.

   <pre><strong>
   jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb
   </strong></pre>

   See https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html

   See https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/1/interactive/nbconvert.html#notebook-format

   ### GitHub

   https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3
   GitHub renders Jupyter Notebooks
   with
   Git Large File Support.


   ### NBViewer

   http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ 
   renders notebooks from a GitHub repo or from notebooks stored elsewhere.


   ### Pandas Slideshows

0. Click the View tab.
