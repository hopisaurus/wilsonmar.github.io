I wrote this page to organize my thinking around a 
one-click command that installs all the pre-requisites and
ends up showing reports for a sample set of scripts
against a sample app.

   <pre><strong>
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/pattern-recognition/master/mac-bootstrap.sh)"
   </strong></pre>

This is similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wilsonmar/Basic-Selenium-Java">Selenium Setup</a>.

This page describes a way to automate clicking and typing on
Mac and Windows machines by
a program you code 
(in <strong>Java</strong>, Python, or Ruby).

This makes you more "productive" at playing games.
But I use it to make screencasts.
Salespeople use it to power their live demos.

A picture is taken of your screen(s).
and the text and location of objects recognized in the picture is fed
to your program to click or type.
Your program then takes another round of picture taking
and object recognition to ensure the results are what are intended.

Several libraries widely used in the 
Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence field
are used here.

To extract text from pictures,
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr">
Tesseract</a> OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
is called.

To recognize the coordinates of objects,
<strong>OpenCV</strong> (Computer Vision) 
is called.

The program that integrates the pieces together is 
<a href="#SikuliX">SikuliX</a> 
maintained by Raimund Hocke aka RaiMan
and supported by enthusiasts on
<a target="_blank" href="https://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli">
Ubuntu Launchpad</a> and

<hr />

The steps to make it work:

0. Install JRE
0. Install Ruby compiler
0. Install Robot Framework (which uses Ruby)
0. Install the IDE you want to use (IntelliJ)
0. <a href="#SikuliXinstall">Download SikuliX</a> 
0. Create a Git folder to hold your scripts.

Install http://sikulix.com/

<hr />

<a name="SikuliXInstall"></a> 

## SikuliX Installation

Instructions below are based on run on Mac 10.12 (Sierra)
referencing http://sikulix.com/quickstart/
and 

0. If this is your first time:<br />
   create a folder to hold Sikulix bits.

   <pre>
   cd ~
   mkdir sikulix
   cd ~/sikulix
   </pre>

   (Capitalization is distracting)

   Otherwise, remove the folder and begin anew.

   <pre><strong>
   rm -rf "~/Library/Application Support/Sikulix"
   </strong><pre>

0. Download from https://launchpad.net/sikuli/+download

   sikulixsetup-1.1.0.jar, 2015-10-06, 3 MB

0. Move the file to your skilux folder.

0. Expand the installer:

   <pre>java -jar sikulixsetup-1.1.0.jar</pre>

   This creates file:<br />
   SikuliX-1.1.1-SetupLog.txt
   and a empty <strong>SetupStuff</strong> folder.

0. Open the txt file and refresh it to see progress.

0. Click checkboxes 1 for Jython and 3 for Tesseract
   in the UI pop-up, then<br />
   <strong>Setup Now</strong>.

0. Click Yes to

   sikulix-setup-ui-2.png

0. Click <strong>No</strong> to pop-ups about 
   Mac native libs (jar's) previously installed into
   /Users/___/Library/Application Support/Sikulix/SikulixDownload_201610061722/...

   sikulix-setup-ui-3.png

0. Click No to get Jython 2.5 due to 2.7 UTF-8 warning:

   sikulix-setup-ui-4-python.png

0. If you get this:

   <pre>
[debug (12/20/16 8:05:24 AM)] RunSetup: downloaded: tessdata-eng
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
  at org.sikuli.setup.RunSetup.main(RunSetup.java:845)
   <pre>

0. Click "OK" to the "Hallo" pop-up.

   Note different files are downloaded for Windows vs. Mac:

   * sikulixjython.jar
   * sikulixlibsmac.jar
   * sikulix.jar 
   * sikulixapi.jar

0. In Finder, move 
   to your user's Applications folder.

0. Move to Trash the installer file
   sikulixsetup-1.1.0.jar

### Robot Framework Install

For a keyword-driven syntax driven by text data files, 
use the
<a target="_blank" href="http://robotframework.org/">
Robot Framework</a> is open-sourced on 
GitHub. 

The core framework is implemented using Python and runs also on Jython (JVM) and IronPython (.NET).
So it's operating system and application independent.

https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide/blob/master/QuickStart.rst

   <pre>
   pip install robotframework
   </pre>

0. To test databases and for example REST APIs.

   pip install robotframework-databaselibrary
   pip install requests
   pip install robotframework-requests



## Scripting

Many of the functions are common to other similar programs,
such as Selenium, HP QTP, etc.


RIDE = Robot IDE.
But there are plugins for IntelliJ/PyCharm & Eclipse,
Atom, Sublime, TextMate, Vim, etc.
