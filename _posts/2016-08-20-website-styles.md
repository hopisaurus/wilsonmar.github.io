Here are examples of what some websites can do to achieve a look that is clean, easy, fun, etc.

### Header #

![ui uber heading 650x169-24kb](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/17858994/191a0122-6845-11e6-826f-46d78cefa94f.jpg)
This form from the <a target="_blank" href="https://t.co/lLaimcvZtg">
Uber Engineering site</a> is a great example.

   0. At the top of each page, a <strong>email collection form</strong> appears because that's the most important interaction.
   0. After the form is filled out, a message appears in place of the form (instead of another location).
   0. The form disapears if entry is successful.

      PROTIP: We only ask for the email to reduce reluctance. 
      Additional information (such as name, etc.) is obtained when the visitor confirms the email.

   ### Contact form #
