Like a good music DJ, I’ve carefully arranged the presentation of concepts

making sense of the flood of material around this topic.

Sentences that begin with <strong>PROTIP</strong> are a high point of this website
to point out wisdom or advice from experience. 
<strong>NOTE</strong> point out observations that many miss to their detriment. Search for them if you only want "TL;DR" (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read">Too Long Didn't Read</a>) highlights.
