## Backpack #

Since I travel a lot, I need a backpack designed for secure <strong>urban</strong>
laptop transportation rather than wilderness bushwacking.

Do the qualities I'm personally looking for below match your needs too?

I've done a survey of various ones out there,
and here's the features I've seen.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Shockproof-Lightweight-ScanSmart-Friendly-Resistant/dp/B01FJJUFEM/">
$42 On Amazon: Kopack Laptop Backpack Shockproof Anti-theft Travel bag Lightweight Hiking Daypack ScanSmart TSA Friendly Waterproof 15.6 16 most 17 inch</a>


### Durability #

- [ ] **Heavy-duty zippers**, as that is where my previous backpacks wore out first.
     "YKK" brand zippers (from Japan) are considered the best.
     New versions are leak-resistant.

- [ ] **Internal compression straps** to keep things from 
   knocking into each other inside the pack.

   Some provide soft pull-out packs. 
   But I prefer harder boxes so they stack neater in the pack.

### Size

   This is a filter for various options available:

- [ ] The <strong>maximum size</strong>
   to qualify as carry-on luggage (22 x 16 x 8 inches) 
   may be too big for some.
   But I would rather cinch up a pack than not have enough room when I need it.

- [ ] **Lightweight** to me is generally 2 pounds or less.
   But it's a trade-off.

- [ ] <strong>Wheels</strong> add weight, 
   so I've steered away from them. (I can't resist the pun).

   But seriously, some (with sore backs) find wheels a must.

### Comfort

- [ ] Adjustable shoulder and side straps really help, especially for women.

- [ ] <strong>water tube</strong> to reach an internal water bag 
   makes it not necessary to stop and remove the bottle for a drink.
   Some bags have them built-in but there are add-ons available.

- [ ] Pack can open completely open (splayed) [Astor]

### Security

- [ ] A **dark gray** color backpack is less noticeable than a bright-colored pack for thieves.

- [ ] **Easily lockable zippers** to make it harder for people standing behind me in line to explore
     the pockets on my backpack

- [ ] A sleek look without side pockets (that never seem to be the right size) [Astor, Minaal]

- [ ] <strong>Cut-proof</strong> fabric [LocTote, XDDesign Bobby]

- [ ] Hidden zippers [XDDesign Bobby]

- [ ] High density foam [XDDesign Bobby]

- [ ] Emergency information slot

- [ ] Alarm. This can be added on.

- [ ] Red LED rear light for safety [Astor]
- [ ] Red LED side light for safety [Astor]
- [ ] Front lights [Astor]
- [ ] Locator beacon (such as Tile)


### Non-features #

I don't care about the pack being:

   * water-tight as I use Ziplock bags and rigid water-tight boxes
    to hold stuff, anyway.

   * Velcro patch to attach skateboard [Unitty]

5 Amazing backpacks #1</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4EK6y0o0M8">
#2</a>:

   * Lumos Astor by Gandharv Bakshi for cyclists with built-in lights.
   * LocTote

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IR2VEUS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IR2VEUS&linkCode=as2&tag=wilsonslifenotes&linkId=LGM2HVV7JYHE5QRS"><img align="right" width="150" src="../images/Cabin Max Metz Backpack.png" /></a>

The backpack that meets my specs:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IR2VEUS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IR2VEUS&linkCode=as2&tag=wilsonslifenotes&linkId=LGM2HVV7JYHE5QRS">Cabin Max Metz Backpack Flight Approved Carry on Bag ($50)</a>

   It's bigger than some backpacks, but the cinch straps on its side flattens it out.

   I'd like to put a patch over the logo, though.

### Alternatives 

Other alteratives I considered:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://sdrtraveller.com/products/d3-traveller">
   The D3 Traveller</a> is a duffle bag which costs $983 because it looks like a used trash can liner.
   It is ultralight even though has double walls of waterproof scan-resistent fabric.

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Farpoint-Travel-Backpack-Volcanic/dp/B014EBM3KA/ref=wilsonslifenotes">Osprey Farpoint 40 Travel Backpack ($160)</a>
   This one's nice but a bit spendy.

   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xd-design.com/">
   XD Design's Boddy</a> from the Netherlands (@XDDesign_) is <strong>sleek looking</strong>
   and anti-theft.
   Estimated to be available for $100
   November 2016 after an April, 2016 campaign

<a name="Locators"></a>

## Locator chips

I got a few Tile
chips when they were first on Kickstarter.

But after a year, when I needed it, I realized
they had died.


<a name="SunProtection"></a>

## Weather Protection

[ ] Sunglasses


<a name="Water"></a>

## Water

A hose to suck water from a sack inside the backpack is great for backpackers.

It's a true luxury to have a hot drink on a cold night or a cold drink on a hot day.

Double-walled canisters keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold.


<a name="Food"></a>

## Food

I keep a couple meals in my pack.

Ideally, it would not have much sugar, salt, MSG, etc.

   * Jerky has a lot of salt

PROTIP: Put a date on each item and enter a replacement appointment on your calendar
so it's eaten before gong stale.

[ ] Long spoon

[ ] Big Cup, made of metal to cook with.

[ ] Herbs and spices you like to add to your food.



<a name="Liquids"></a>

## Liquids bag

[ ] Shampoo

[ ] Sunscreen

[ ] Hand sanitizer

[ ] Hair gel

[ ] Personal lubricant. Jo hybrid is our favorite.

[ ] Bug repellant

[ ] Matches

[ ] Trowel

[ ] Nylon cord

[ ] Whistle

[ ] Compass

[ ] Mirror

[ ] Nail clipper

[ ] Wash Towel (polyester for faster drying than cotton)
   Use it to clean computer screens.


<a name="Clothing"></a>

## Clothing

PROTIP: An extra pair of socks and underwear makes for great padding at the bottom for electronics.

[ ] A rainsuit (with pants) takes less room than I thought. The Frogger

   The rainsuit means I don't need to carry around an umbrella, which doesn't work that well anyway.

[ ] Big waterproof bag for storing soiled underwear.

[ ] Underwear from Ex-officio, at $25 each, is worth every penny for its comfort and quick-drying properties
   (not cotton)

[ ] Hat, because you loose a lot of heat.

[ ] Gloves with touch-screen fingertips.

[ ] Woolite Travel Laundry Soap or Travelon Laundry Soap Sheets 
   so you can hand wash laundry in a sink.

[ ] Scarf

[ ] Stain remover

[ ] Extra bag for souvenirs

[ ] Money & passport hider


<a name="Shelter"></a>

## Shelter

A tent and sleeping bag are really the two items which separate a city packing and wilderness packing.

But here are a few items when you don't have 600-count sheets in a five-star hotel:

[ ] A "space" or "survival" mylar reflective blanket is less than an once.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mylar-Mens-Emergency-Thermal-Blankets/dp/B007IYIYFE/ref=wilsonslifenotes?ie=UTF8&qid=1477256492&sr=8-1&keywords=space+blanket">
   $6.20 for 10</a>

   I was glad I had one to put on top of someone who had fallen, passed out on the sidewalk.
   That may keep someone from going into shock.

[ ] <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cocoon-TravelSheet-Natural-86-Inch-35-Inch/dp/B001DX9YTQ/ref=wilsonslifenotes?ie=UTF8&qid=1477256236&sr=8-1&keywords=Silk+Sleep+Sacks">
   $50 Cocoon Silk TravelSheet</a> 
   Silk Sleep Sack) keeps your skin away from quesionable sheets
   with a nice-feeling one. Lightweight and compresses to a small size.

[ ] Clear repair duct tape. A small roll to patch fabric tears.
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00O9JNY9W/ref=wilsonslifenotes?ie=UTF8&mv_size_name=0&qid=1477256614&sr=8-1/"> 
   $5.80 for 5 yards 1.5 inch wide</a>.


<a name="Lighting"></a>

## Lighting

[ ] Flashlight. Have it near where you can reach in the dark.



<a name="Electrical"></a>

## Electrical

[ ] In many airports, my electrical cord with 3-prong plugs enabled me to keep my stuff charged.

[ ] There is a big battery to power my Mac laptop for a few hours.
   But it's heavy.

[ ] Instead of turning on the light to wake everyone up,
   Streamlight 73001 Nano Light Miniature Keychain LED Flashlight is an amazing little flashlight that is super bright and tiny.

[ ] I have a Mac, so I need a VGA monitor adapter. And an Ethernet network dongle.

   PROTIP: I don't recommend solar panels. Small ones don't make that much energy. Plus I'm not outside much.


<a name="Headphones"></a>

## Headphones

Where do I get those headsets that the feds and CIA wear,
so I can look bad-ass too?

There is nothing that says "leave me alone" like having headphones on.

In-ear headphones hurt my ear.


<a name="Adapters"></a>

## Adapters

[ ] Micro USB to USB-A to transfer and charge Android mobile phone.

[ ] PROTIP: The Android mobile battery charger enables me to charge one battery while another is being used.

   PROTIP: The ability to remove and replace batteries is why I went with Android rather than iPhones.

[ ] A Google Cast HDMI plug and micro-USB electrical with a long chord
   to project to a TV from your laptop.
