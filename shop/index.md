Over time, people have asked me where they can get some of my stuff.
Here's some of them.

## Backpack

Since I travel a lot, I need a backpack possessing designed for secure urban
laptop carry rather than wilderness bushwacking.

Qualities I'm personally looking for,
listed with the highest priority on top:

Durability:

- [ ] **Heavy-duty zippers**, as that is where my previous backpacks wore out first.
- [ ] Internal compression straps to keep things from knocking into each other inside the pack.

Comfort:

- [ ] Be the maximum size to qualify as carry-on luggage (22 x 16 x 8 inches).
- [ ] Adjustable shoulder and side straps.
- [ ] Lightweight. Generally around 2 pounds. The wheels add weight.
- [ ] External water tube to internal water bag (not requiring removal of bag to drink)

Security features:

- [ ] **Easily lockable zippers** to make it harder for people standing behind me in line to explore
     the pockets on my backpack.
- [ ] A sleek look without side pockets (that never seem to be the right size) [Astor]
- [ ] Cut-proof fabric [LocTote, XDDesign Bobby]
- [ ] Hidden zippers [XDDesign Bobby]
- [ ] Alarm movement.
- [ ] High density foam [XDDesign Bobby]
- [ ] Emergency information slot.

Features that can be added:

- [ ] Red LED rear light for safety [Astor]
- [ ] Red LED side light for safety [Astor]
- [ ] Front lights [Astor]
- [ ] Locator beacon (such as Tile)
- [ ] Completely open (splayed) [Astor]

I don't care about the pack being:

   * water-tight as I use a Ziplock bag to hold each item, anyway.
   * Velcro patch to attach skateboard [Unitty]

The backpack that meets my specs:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IR2VEUS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IR2VEUS&linkCode=as2&tag=wilsonslifenotes&linkId=LGM2HVV7JYHE5QRS">Cabin Max Metz Backpack Flight Approved Carry on Bag ($50)</a>

   It's bigger than some backpacks, but the cinch straps on its side flattens it out.

   I'd like to put a patch over the logo, though.

Other alteratives I considered:

   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Osprey-Farpoint-Travel-Backpack-Volcanic/dp/B014EBM3KA/ref=wilsonslifenotes">Osprey Farpoint 40 Travel Backpack ($160)</a>
   This one's nice but a bit spendy.

## Locator chips

I got a few Tile
chips when they were first on Kickstarter.


## Headphones

Where do I get those headsets that the feds and CIA wear,
so I can look bad-ass too?


There is nothing that says "leave me alone" like having headphones on.


In-ear headphones hurt my ear.
